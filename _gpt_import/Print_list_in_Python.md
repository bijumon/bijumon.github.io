in python print a list without a newline except at the end
## assistant

In Python, to print a list **without a newline after each item**, and only a newline **at the end**, you can use the `end=""` parameter in `print()` inside a loop.

Here’s the simplest way:

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

for item in my_list:
    print(item, end=' ')
print()  # final newline
```

### Output:
```
1 2 3 4 5 
```

You can customize the separator (`' '` here) or make it empty (`''`) if you want no space between items.

If you want to do the same thing using a **single print statement**, use `join()` with `map()`:

```python
print(' '.join(map(str, my_list)))
```

This automatically ends with a newline but prints all items in one line.

in python print a list with a seperator '-' with a newline at the end

## assistant

In Python, to print a list with a separator `'-'` and a newline at the end, you can use the `join` method like this:

```python
my_list = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
print('-'.join(my_list))
```

This automatically adds a newline at the end (because `print()` adds a newline by default).

If you want to be explicit:

```python
print('-'.join(my_list) + '\n')
```

But usually the first version is preferred.

what dows pytest --capture=no do
## assistant
The `--capture=no` option in **pytest** disables output capturing during test execution. Here's what that means and why it's useful:

---

### 🔍 By default, pytest captures output
When you run tests, pytest **captures** all output (e.g., `print()`, logging to stdout/stderr) so that the terminal stays clean unless a test fails. This means you won't see `print()` output unless:

- A test fails
- You use options to show it (like `-s` or `--capture=no`)

---

### ✅ What `--capture=no` does

```bash
pytest --capture=no
```

This tells pytest:

> **Don't capture stdout/stderr. Show all print/log output live in the terminal as it happens.**

---

### 🧠 Use cases
- **Debugging:** You want to see `print()` statements while a test runs.
- **Interactive input/output:** Your test interacts with the user or shell.
- **Realtime feedback:** You're troubleshooting something and want all logs immediately.

---

### 🔁 Related alternative
A shorter version:

```bash
pytest -s
```

This is equivalent to `--capture=no`.

### 📌 Summary
| Option             | Effect                         |
|--------------------|--------------------------------|
| `--capture=no`     | Disables capturing, shows all output live |
| `-s`               | Same as `--capture=no`         |
