Analyzing your Twitter/X profile at [https://x.com/bijupunalor](https://x.com/bijupunalor) to identify followers who have a `bsky.app` link in their profiles requires access to detailed follower data, which is typically restricted by Twitter's privacy policies. However, there are tools designed to help users find and reconnect with their Twitter contacts on Bluesky.

One such tool is **Follow the Sky**, which allows users to match their Twitter following list with Bluesky accounts. By exporting your Twitter following list and uploading it to this tool, you can discover which of your contacts have migrated to Bluesky. citeturn0search5

Additionally, **Sky Follower Bridge** offers a similar service, enabling users to reconnect with their Twitter network on Bluesky effortlessly. citeturn0search1

Please note that these tools focus on identifying your Twitter contacts who are now on Bluesky, rather than analyzing follower profiles for specific links. Due to privacy restrictions, obtaining a list of your followers who have a `bsky.app` link in their profiles directly from Twitter is not feasible.
