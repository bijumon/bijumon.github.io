how can i check if a file starts with '+++' or '---' in python? this should ignore newlines

You can check if a file starts with '+++' or '---' in Python by reading the first few characters of the file and checking if they match the desired strings. Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates this approach:

```python
with open('filename.txt', 'r') as f:
    first_chars = f.read(3)  # Read the first 3 characters of the file
    if first_chars.rstrip('\n') == '+++' or first_chars.rstrip('\n') == '---':
        print('File starts with +++ or ---')
    else:
        print('File does not start with +++ or ---')
```

In this example, `open()` is used to open the file in read mode, and `read(3)` is used to read the first 3 characters of the file. The `rstrip('\n')` method is used to remove any trailing newline characters, since we want to ignore newlines when checking for the string. Finally, we check if the first three characters match the desired strings using an if statement.

You can open the file using Python's built-in `open()` function and then read the first line of the file using the `readline()` method. Then, you can strip any whitespace characters from the beginning of the line using the `lstrip()` method and compare the result to the expected prefix using the `startswith()` method.

Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates this approach:

```
with open('filename.txt', 'r') as file:
    first_line = file.readline().rstrip('\n').lstrip()
    if first_line.startswith('+++') or first_line.startswith('---'):
        print('The file starts with +++ or ---')
    else:
        print('The file does not start with +++ or ---')
```

In this code, `filename.txt` is the name of the file you want to check. The `with` statement is used to ensure that the file is properly closed after it is read. The `rstrip('\n')` method is used to remove any newline characters from the end of the first line, and the `lstrip()` method is used to remove any leading whitespace characters. Finally, the `startswith()` method is used to check if the line starts with the expected prefix.
