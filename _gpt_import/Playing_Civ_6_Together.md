How to win dominating at settler difficulty as trajan
## assistant
Winning a domination victory at Settler difficulty with Trajan in Civilization VI should be relatively straightforward. Here are some tips to help you dominate the game:

### Early Game Strategy
1. **Exploration and Expansion:**
   - Start by exploring your surroundings with your initial Warrior and Scout.
   - Prioritize settling cities near resources, especially strategic resources like Iron and Horses.

2. **Building and Research:**
   - Build a balanced combination of Settlers, Builders, and military units.
   - Focus your research on technologies that unlock early military units, such as Archery, Bronze Working (for Swordsmen), and Horseback Riding (for Horsemen).

3. **Civic Progression:**
   - Aim to unlock military-focused civics like Military Tradition (for flanking and support combat bonuses) and Feudalism (for additional Builder actions).

### Mid-Game Strategy
4. **Military Production:**
   - Build Barracks, Stables, and Encampments to boost your military production.
   - Produce a strong army consisting of Swordsmen, Horsemen, and Catapults or Trebuchets.

5. **Strategic Warfare:**
   - Identify weaker neighboring civilizations and target them first.
   - Use a combination of melee units (Swordsmen) and ranged units (Archers/Catapults) to siege cities effectively.

6. **City Management:**
   - Capture and keep cities with valuable resources and good strategic positions.
   - Puppet cities that are less useful or too far from your capital to manage directly.

### Late Game Strategy
7. **Advanced Military Units:**
   - Continue to upgrade your units as you unlock new technologies.
   - Build a mix of Infantry, Cavalry, and Artillery units.

8. **Global Domination:**
   - Systematically target the capitals of other civilizations.
   - Use spies to weaken enemy defenses and gather intelligence on their troop movements.

### General Tips
- **Utilize Trajan’s Abilities:**
   - Take advantage of Trajan’s unique ability, "Trajan’s Column," which gives each city a free building in the city center.
   - This can help with early infrastructure, allowing you to focus more on military production.

- **Trade and Diplomacy:**
   - Use diplomacy to keep other civilizations friendly or at least neutral until you are ready to attack them.
   - Trade surplus resources and gold to fund your war efforts.

- **Efficient City Management:**
   - Ensure your cities are well-defended and have adequate production to support your war machine.
   - Balance your empire’s economy to avoid falling behind in technology or culture.

By following these strategies, you should be able to achieve a domination victory on Settler difficulty as Trajan in Civilization VI.
