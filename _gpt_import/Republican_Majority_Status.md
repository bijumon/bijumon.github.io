Does republicans have majority in house, senate and the presidency 
## assistant

As of the latest information in November 2024, Republicans hold a majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, although by a relatively slim margin following the 2022 midterms, where they gained control but lost some seats in 2024. In the Senate, control is more closely contested, with current projections suggesting a nearly even split around 50 seats, depending on final results from some competitive states【8†source】【9†source】.

As for the presidency, the 2024 election results are yet to be finalized in several key states, and as such, the outcome remains uncertain. This balance of power may continue to shift as official results come in and states finalize their counts.
