i have 32GB RAM and 16GB vram , which local models can i run
## assistant

With 32‚ÄØGB of system RAM and 16‚ÄØGB of VRAM, you have a solid machine capable of running many **local AI models**, especially LLMs and image generation models. Here's a breakdown of what you can comfortably run:

---

### üîÆ **Large Language Models (LLMs)**

With 16‚ÄØGB of VRAM, you're in a great spot to run **7B parameter models** fully on the GPU, and **13B models** with some offloading.

#### ‚úÖ Easily Run:
- **LLaMA 2 7B**
- **Mistral 7B**
- **Gemma 7B**
- **Nous Hermes 2 (Mistral or LLaMA2 base)**
- **OpenHermes 2.5 / MythoMax (7B)**

These can be run in **quantized formats (GGUF/Q4_0 or Q4_K_M)** using **LM Studio**, **oobabooga/text-generation-webui**, or **llama.cpp**.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Medium VRAM Models (with RAM Offload or Q5/Q6):
- **LLaMA 2 13B**
- **Yi 12B**
- **Deepseek 13B**
- These can be run with some VRAM+RAM offloading or highly quantized formats (Q4_K_S or Q5_0).

#### üöÄ High-End (Possible with Optimization):
- **Mixtral 8x7B MoE** ‚Äì Since it's a Mixture-of-Experts model, only 2 experts are active at once (~12-14B total load).
- **GPT-J / GPT-NeoX 6B-20B** ‚Äì Use with quantization and offloading.

---

### üé® **Image Generation Models**

Your 16GB VRAM lets you run **Stable Diffusion** models with **high resolutions** and custom pipelines:

#### ‚úÖ Works Smoothly:
- **Stable Diffusion 1.5, 2.1** at full 512x512, even 768x768
- **SDXL** (10‚Äì12GB VRAM usage) ‚Äî you can run it natively!
- Tools: **AUTOMATIC1111 WebUI**, **ComfyUI**, **Fooocus**

#### ‚ö° Fast Inference With:
- **LoRAs**, **ControlNet**, **Tiled Diffusion** for upscaling
- Real-time image2image, inpainting, txt2img

#### Bonus: You can also run:
- **Kandinsky 2.2**
- **DeepFloyd IF (1st stage only on 16GB VRAM)**
- **Runway‚Äôs Gen-1 (experimental with tricks)**

---

### üß† Multimodal Models

#### ‚úÖ You Can Try:
- **LLaVA 1.5 (7B)** ‚Äì Vision+Language model
- **BakLLaVA**
- **MiniGPT-4** (7B+vision encoder)

Use tools like **llava.cpp**, **oobabooga**, or **KoboldCpp**.

---

### üß∞ Tools You Might Use

- **text-generation-webui**: Most flexible LLM GUI
- **LM Studio**: Easiest desktop runner for GGUF LLMs
- **KoboldCpp**: Good for story/roleplay generation
- **AUTOMATIC1111 / ComfyUI**: For Stable Diffusion
- **InvokeAI**: Clean alternative to A1111 with good RAM optimization

---

If you tell me what **kind of work or models** you‚Äôre most interested in (chat, coding, storytelling, image gen, etc.), I can give you a curated list with download links and settings tuned to your system!
## user
Can I run 14b
## assistant
Yes, **you can run 14B models** on your setup ‚Äî but with some **trade-offs**.

You have **32‚ÄØGB RAM** and **16‚ÄØGB VRAM**, so you won‚Äôt be able to fit a 14B model *fully* in VRAM, but you can run it using **quantization** and **CPU+GPU offloading**.

---

### ‚úÖ **Ways You *Can* Run 14B Models**

#### 1. **Quantized GGUF models (Q4_K_M or Q5_0)**  
Use with **llama.cpp**, **KoboldCpp**, or **LM Studio**.

- These reduce the memory footprint enough to allow:
  - **~8‚Äì10GB VRAM usage**
  - **20‚Äì24GB system RAM usage**
- You‚Äôll get **decent performance**, though not as fast as 7B models.
- Models:  
  - **LLaMA 2 13B / 14B variants (e.g., MythoMax-L2 13B)**  
  - **Yi 14B GGUF**  
  - **Deepseek 14B**  
  - **WizardLM 2 13B / 14B**

#### 2. **text-generation-webui** with offloading  
- Run the model with **`--gpu-memory 16` and `--cpu-memory 32`**
- Load a **GPTQ quantized model**, like `Q4_0` or `Q4_K_M`
- Set **low RAM usage settings**, turn off extra extensions

#### 3. **ExLlamaV2 + GPTQ**  
Best performance for quantized models on GPU (with limited VRAM).  
- You can use this in **text-generation-webui**

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- 14B models are **slower** than 7B, but provide **better context comprehension**, logic, and coherence.
- You‚Äôll need to be careful with **VRAM spikes** ‚Äî close other apps (like browsers) before loading.
- Prefer **`--gpu-memory 12` and `--cpu-memory 20`** if you want to multitask.

---

### TL;DR

| Model Size | Can You Run It? | Recommended Format |
|------------|------------------|---------------------|
| 7B         | Easily           | GGUF (Q4_K_M or Q5) |
| 13‚Äì14B     | Yes (with tweaks) | GGUF (Q4_K_M) or GPTQ |
| 30B        | Not recommended   | Needs >48GB RAM / VRAM |

---

If you want, I can suggest some top-performing **14B models** (e.g., for coding, RP, chat, etc.) and where to get them. Just let me know what you're into!
## user
Can I run 32b
## assistant
Running **32B models** on your system with **32GB RAM** and **16GB VRAM** is **not recommended** for most use cases ‚Äî but technically **possible** with **heavy trade-offs** and smart optimization.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Why It's Tough

- **Full 32B models**, even quantized to `Q4_K_M`, usually need:
  - **~28‚Äì35 GB of system RAM**
  - **10‚Äì16 GB VRAM**, *bare minimum*
- You'll be at or near the limit on both **RAM and VRAM**
- Performance will be **very slow**, with **long load and response times**

---

### ‚úÖ You *Can* Try If You're Determined

#### 1. **Use GGUF quantized models**
- Format: `Q4_K_M`, `Q4_0`, or even `Q3_K_M` if you're desperate
- Tools: **llama.cpp**, **KoboldCpp**, **LM Studio**

#### 2. **Launch with low VRAM usage**
- Example:
  ```
  --gpu-memory 12 --cpu-memory 24 --threads 8 --low-vram
  ```

#### 3. **Use swap (pagefile)**
- On Linux: zswap or zram helps
- On Windows: Enable pagefile on SSD

---

### Real-World Result:
- **Yes**, you *can* load some 32B GGUF models
- But:
  - **Startup may take 5‚Äì10+ mins**
  - **Each response may lag**
  - System may stutter if swap is hit hard

---

### Alternative Tip:
Instead of 32B, try a **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model** like **Mixtral 8x7B**:
- Activates **only 2 experts (14B total)** per prompt
- Gives 32B-tier quality with 13B-level RAM/VRAM usage
- Works *well* on 32GB RAM + 16GB VRAM

---

### TL;DR

| Model      | Can You Run It? | Notes |
|------------|------------------|-------|
| 7B         | Yes, easily       | Fastest |
| 13B/14B    | Yes, good balance | Ideal upper limit |
| 32B        | Yes, barely       | Very slow, not practical |
| Mixtral 8x7B | Yes, recommended | Smart 14B load with 32B output quality |

---

Want me to find a **specific 32B model** (or a better MoE alternative) to try with your setup?
## user
can i run OpenCodeInterpreter-DS-33B
## assistant
You can **technically run** `OpenCodeInterpreter-DS-33B` on your system (32GB RAM, 16GB VRAM), **but it's going to be very tight** and may not be practically usable **unless you're okay with slow inference or using CPU-only modes**.

---

### üß† About OpenCodeInterpreter-DS-33B

- It‚Äôs a **33B parameter model**, fine-tuned for code generation and interpretation
- Based on Deepseek Coder 33B
- Available in **GGUF format** and can also be used in **GPTQ or vLLM setups**
- Needs **~65‚Äì70GB RAM to run full precision (FP16)**
- GGUF quantizations lower this, but still heavy

---

### üß∞ What You Can Do with Your Setup

#### ‚úÖ **GGUF quantized version + llama.cpp / LM Studio / KoboldCpp**
- Use **Q3_K_M** or **Q4_0** (heavily quantized)
- Run in **CPU + partial GPU offload**
- Will eat **28‚Äì32GB system RAM**
- **VRAM usage ~12‚Äì14GB**

üí° You'll need:
- No background apps
- Swap enabled (ideally on SSD)
- Patience for slow inference (especially on first prompt)

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Expect:

| Aspect              | Result                              |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Load time           | 5‚Äì10+ minutes                       |
| Token gen speed     | Slow (0.5‚Äì2 tokens/sec max)         |
| RAM usage           | All 32GB used, may use swap         |
| Stability           | Risk of crashing at high load       |
| Quality             | Excellent for code, if it runs      |

---

### üí° Better Alternatives for 33B-class Performance:

#### ‚úÖ **Deepseek Coder 6.7B or 13B**
- Surprisingly powerful, faster on your setup

#### ‚úÖ **OpenHermes 2.5 Mistral / Deepseek 14B**
- Faster response, good code support

#### ‚úÖ **Mixtral 8x7B** (again!)
- MoE gives near 30B quality but needs only ~14B active memory

---

### ‚úÖ TL;DR: Can you run OpenCodeInterpreter-DS-33B?

| Format         | Can You Run? | Notes |
|----------------|--------------|-------|
| FP16 / full model | ‚ùå No         | Needs >65GB RAM |
| GGUF (Q3/Q4)    | ‚ö†Ô∏è Yes, barely | Use llama.cpp, slow, needs patience |
| GPTQ           | ‚ùå Not practical | RAM/VRAM too tight |
