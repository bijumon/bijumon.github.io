If you're logged out of GitHub everywhere and it's asking for **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**, here's how you can log back in, depending on your situation:

---

### ‚úÖ **Option A: You still have access to your 2FA device**
If you **still have your 2FA app** (like Google Authenticator, Authy, 1Password, etc.):

1. Go to [https://github.com/login](https://github.com/login)
2. Enter your **username/email** and **password**
3. You‚Äôll be prompted for your **2FA code**:
   - Open your 2FA app
   - Enter the 6-digit code GitHub requests

You‚Äôre in!

---

### ‚ùå **Option B: You lost access to your 2FA device**
If you **don't have your 2FA app anymore**, you‚Äôll need **one of the following**:

#### 1. **Recovery codes**
GitHub gives you a set of **recovery codes** when you set up 2FA. If you saved them:
- Enter one at the 2FA prompt instead of the 6-digit code.

#### 2. **A logged-in session somewhere**
If you still have GitHub logged in on a device (browser, GitHub Desktop, CLI):
- Use that session to turn off 2FA:
  - Go to **Settings ‚Üí Password and authentication ‚Üí Two-factor authentication**
  - Click **Disable**

#### 3. **SSH access or GitHub CLI**
If you‚Äôre still authenticated via SSH or GitHub CLI:
- You can generate a **personal access token** or manage 2FA settings:
```sh
gh auth login
```
Then follow prompts and generate a new token.

---

### üÜò **Option C: You have no recovery codes, device, or access**
You‚Äôll have to **recover your account**:

1. Go to the login page and **enter your credentials**
2. When it asks for 2FA, click **‚ÄúTrouble with two-factor authentication?‚Äù**
3. Select **‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have access to my 2FA device‚Äù**
4. GitHub will guide you through the **account recovery process**, which may take a few days.
