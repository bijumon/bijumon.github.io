**Mother and Son**  
*(In the style of Scorpions' "Winds of Change")*

*Verse 1:*  
I remember the days when I was young,  
You held my hand, you kept me strong,  
In your arms, I found my way,  
Through the night and into the day.  

*Pre-Chorus:*  
Time goes by like a river's flow,  
But your love, it will always grow,  
Through the storms and through the pain,  
In my heart, you still remain.  

*Chorus:*  
Oh, Mother, you’re the guiding light,  
In the darkness, you shine so bright,  
Through the changes, you stay the same,  
In this life, we’ll win the game.  
Mother and son, forever one,  
Together we’ll rise like the sun.  

*Verse 2:*  
The winds of change, they come and go,  
But your wisdom helps me to know,  
That no matter where I roam,  
In your heart, I’ll always find my home.  

*Pre-Chorus:*  
Time moves on, but the love we share,  
It’s a flame that will always care,  
Through the shadows, through the tears,  
You’re the voice that calms my fears.  

*Chorus:*  
Oh, Mother, you’re the guiding light,  
In the darkness, you shine so bright,  
Through the changes, you stay the same,  
In this life, we’ll win the game.  
Mother and son, forever one,  
Together we’ll rise like the sun.  

*Bridge:*  
And as the years go passing by,  
I see the love in your eyes,  
Though the world may change its tune,  
Our bond will never fade too soon.  

*Chorus:*  
Oh, Mother, you’re the guiding light,  
In the darkness, you shine so bright,  
Through the changes, you stay the same,  
In this life, we’ll win the game.  
Mother and son, forever one,  
Together we’ll rise like the sun.  

*Outro:*  
Mother and son, under the moon,  
Dancing to the same old tune,  
In your love, I find my way,  
Through the night and into the day.
