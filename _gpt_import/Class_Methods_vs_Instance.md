python class methods vs object

In Python, there are two main types of methods associated with classes: class methods and instance methods (sometimes called object methods).

1. **Instance Methods**:
   - Instance methods are the most common type of methods in Python classes.
   - They operate on an instance of the class, meaning they have access to and can modify the instance's attributes.
   - They are defined using the `def` keyword within the class, and the first parameter is typically `self`, which refers to the instance itself.
   - Instance methods can access both instance variables and class variables.

Example:
```python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
    
    def instance_method(self):
        print("Instance method called with value:", self.value)

obj = MyClass(5)
obj.instance_method()  # Output: Instance method called with value: 5
```

2. **Class Methods**:
   - Class methods are bound to the class itself rather than an instance of the class.
   - They are defined using the `@classmethod` decorator before the method definition.
   - The first parameter of a class method is traditionally named `cls` and refers to the class itself.
   - Class methods can access and modify class-level variables but don't have access to instance-specific data.

Example:
```python
class MyClass:
    class_variable = 10
    
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
    
    @classmethod
    def class_method(cls):
        print("Class method called with class variable:", cls.class_variable)

MyClass.class_method()  # Output: Class method called with class variable: 10
```

So, in summary, instance methods are associated with instances of a class and can access and modify instance variables, while class methods are associated with the class itself and can access and modify class-level variables.
