if 1 gb is 1024MB, how much is 256MB
## assistant
To convert 256 MB to GB, we use the fact that 1 GB is equal to 1024 MB. The conversion can be done by dividing the number of megabytes by 1024.

\[ \text{Value in GB} = \frac{\text{Value in MB}}{1024} \]

Substituting the given value:

\[ \text{Value in GB} = \frac{256 \, \text{MB}}{1024} \]

\[ \text{Value in GB} = 0.25 \, \text{GB} \]

Therefore, 256 MB is equal to 0.25 GB.

1000GB - 0.25GB - 64GB
## assistant
To perform the subtraction:

\[ 1000 \, \text{GB} - 0.25 \, \text{GB} - 64 \, \text{GB} \]

First, subtract 0.25 GB from 1000 GB:

\[ 1000 \, \text{GB} - 0.25 \, \text{GB} = 999.75 \, \text{GB} \]

Next, subtract 64 GB from 999.75 GB:

\[ 999.75 \, \text{GB} - 64 \, \text{GB} = 935.75 \, \text{GB} \]

So, the result is:

\[ 935.75 \, \text{GB} \]
