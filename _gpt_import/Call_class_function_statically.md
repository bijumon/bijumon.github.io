in python how can i run a class function without creating an object

In Python, to run a class function without creating an object, you can use either a `@staticmethod` or a `@classmethod`. These allow methods to be called on the class itself, without requiring an instance of the class.

### 1. Using `@staticmethod`
A `staticmethod` doesnâ€™t take a `self` or `cls` argument. It behaves like a regular function, but it belongs to the class's namespace.

```python
class MyClass:
    @staticmethod
    def my_static_method(arg):
        print(f"Static method called with argument: {arg}")

# Call the method without creating an instance
MyClass.my_static_method("Hello")
```

### 2. Using `@classmethod`
A `classmethod` takes a `cls` parameter that refers to the class itself. This allows the method to interact with class-level data.

```python
class MyClass:
    class_variable = "I am a class variable"

    @classmethod
    def my_class_method(cls):
        print(f"Class method called. Class variable: {cls.class_variable}")

# Call the method without creating an instance
MyClass.my_class_method()
```

### When to Use Each
- Use `@staticmethod` for utility functions that do not need to access or modify the class or instance state.
- Use `@classmethod` when you need access to the class itself (e.g., to modify class-level variables or create instances).

in python how to specify  class variable type
## assistant
In Python, you can specify the type of a class variable using type hints, which are part of Python's `typing` module and type hinting system introduced in Python 3.5. You can annotate class variables using the following syntax:

### Basic Syntax
```python
class MyClass:
    my_var: int = 0  # Class variable with type hint for an integer
    my_str: str = "default"  # Class variable with type hint for a string
```

### Using `typing` Module for More Complex Types
For more complex types, you can use the `typing` module. For example:

```python
from typing import List, Dict, Optional

class MyClass:
    my_list: List[int] = []  # List of integers
    my_dict: Dict[str, int] = {}  # Dictionary with string keys and integer values
    my_optional: Optional[str] = None  # A string that can also be None
```

### Example with Explanation
```python
from typing import List

class MyClass:
    items: List[str] = ["apple", "banana"]  # Class variable of type List[str]

# Accessing the class variable
print(MyClass.items)
```

### Note
- Class variable type hints are for documentation and static type checking. They do not enforce the type at runtime.
- Use tools like **mypy** for static type checking to validate these annotations. 

### Special Case: `typing.ClassVar`
When you want to indicate that a variable is specifically a class variable (not an instance variable), use `ClassVar` from the `typing` module:

```python
from typing import ClassVar

class MyClass:
    class_var: ClassVar[int] = 42  # Explicitly marks this as a class variable
```

`ClassVar` is particularly useful in scenarios where you want to distinguish class variables from instance variables during type checks.
