gamemoderun taskset -c 0-5 %command%
## assistant

This command is a combination of `gamemoderun` and `taskset`, which is used to optimize gaming performance on Linux.

### Breakdown of the Command:
1. **`gamemoderun`**:
   - This utility is part of [GameMode](https://github.com/FeralInteractive/gamemode), an open-source tool designed to optimize Linux for gaming. Running a game with `gamemoderun` enables GameMode, which can dynamically adjust settings like CPU governor, I/O priority, and more to improve gaming performance.
   - Youâ€™d typically prepend this to a game command to run it with these performance enhancements.

2. **`taskset -c 0-5`**:
   - `taskset` is used to set the CPU affinity for a specific task or command, meaning it restricts the command to run on certain CPU cores.
   - Here, `-c 0-5` tells the command to only use cores 0 through 5, which is a way to limit the game (or application) to run on a subset of available CPU cores. This can be beneficial for performance if you want to dedicate certain cores exclusively to a game or reduce contention with other processes.

3. **`%command%`**:
   - This placeholder represents the command to run the game or application.

### Example Usage:
```bash
gamemoderun taskset -c 0-5 ./mygame
```

This would:
1. Start `mygame` with GameMode enabled.
2. Limit `mygame` to run on CPU cores 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. 

This approach can help optimize performance by focusing resources and managing CPU core usage efficiently, especially useful for systems with multiple cores or threads.
