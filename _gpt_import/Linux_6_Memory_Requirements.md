Will linux 6 run on 32mb of ram
## assistant

Linux kernel 6.x is relatively modern and might not perform well with just 32MB of RAM. Most modern distributions and kernels are designed with higher memory requirements in mind. However, you might have success with a very minimal or specialized distribution that's tailored for low-resource systems, like Tiny Core Linux or a lightweight version of Debian. These can often run on older or very minimal hardware configurations.

Linux kernel version 6, like most modern Linux kernels, requires significantly more than 32 MB of RAM to run effectively. While you might be able to compile a minimal kernel and boot it in an extremely constrained environment, the system's functionality would be highly limited. 

In practice, even very minimal Linux distributions typically require at least 128 MB to 512 MB of RAM to function with a basic command-line interface. A standard Linux installation with more typical desktop environments requires much more.

For a system with only 32 MB of RAM, you'd likely need to look at very old versions of Linux (e.g., Linux 2.x series) or even other extremely lightweight operating systems designed for embedded or low-memory devices.
