In don't starve I've built a crockbox, some farms and managed to survive 10 days, what now

Great job surviving the first 10 days! Here's what you can focus on next in *Don't Starve*:

1. **Explore the Map**: Start exploring more of the map to find key resources and landmarks like Beefalo herds, Pig King, Touch Stones, and other biomes. This will help you plan for the coming seasons.

2. **Prepare for Winter**: Winter arrives around day 21, so you’ll want to start gathering resources for it. Make a thermal stone to keep warm, stockpile food that doesn’t spoil quickly (jerky, dried meat, cooked meals), and consider building a winter hat or a puffy vest.

3. **Gather Materials**: Collect resources like gold, stone, and wood. You’ll need these for more advanced structures and tools.

4. **Build a Base**: Now that you have a crock pot and farms, start expanding your base. You might want to build a chest or two for storage, a drying rack for food preservation, and a lightning rod to protect against storms.

5. **Upgrade Tools and Gear**: Start crafting better tools and armor. A spear and log suit can be lifesavers during combat.

6. **Farm and Manage Food**: Keep your farms going and consider trapping rabbits or hunting for additional food sources. Drying racks and crock pots are your best friends for preserving food.

7. **Hunt and Gather**: Consider going after more challenging prey like spiders (for silk) or beefalo (for fur and meat). 

8. **Set Traps**: Set traps for rabbits or spiders to keep a steady supply of food and materials like silk.

9. **Plan for Hounds**: Around day 9-12, you’ll encounter your first hound attack. Make sure you have weapons ready and consider building walls or leading them to a herd of beefalo for protection.

10. **Craft Science and Alchemy Machines**: If you haven’t already, craft the Science Machine and Alchemy Engine to unlock more advanced recipes and gear.

Each step builds toward ensuring your survival as the game gets progressively harder. Good luck!
