howto build Nobara linux 40 kernel rpm with zen4 optimisation
## assistant

Building a custom Linux kernel RPM for Nobara Linux with Zen 4 optimizations involves the following steps. Nobara is a Fedora-based distro, so the process is similar to building a custom kernel for Fedora.

### **Steps to Build a Zen 4 Optimized Kernel RPM**

#### **1. Prepare Your Environment**
1. **Install Required Tools**:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install rpm-build make gcc perl dwarves ncurses-devel elfutils-libelf-devel bc wget git
   ```
   Ensure `dnf-plugins-core` is installed for managing source repositories:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install dnf-plugins-core
   ```

2. **Set Up RPM Build Environment**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/rpmbuild/{BUILD,RPMS,SOURCES,SPECS,SRPMS}
   echo '%_topdir %(echo $HOME)/rpmbuild' > ~/.rpmmacros
   ```

#### **2. Fetch the Kernel Source**
1. Enable the source repository for your Nobara version:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf config-manager --enable nobara-source
   ```

2. Download the source RPM for the Nobara kernel:
   ```bash
   dnf download --source kernel
   ```

3. Extract the source RPM:
   ```bash
   rpm -ivh kernel-*.src.rpm
   ```

   The source files will be placed in `~/rpmbuild/SOURCES/`.

#### **3. Configure the Kernel for Zen 4 Optimization**
1. **Edit the SPEC File**:
   The SPEC file is in `~/rpmbuild/SPECS/kernel.spec`. Open it with a text editor:
   ```bash
   nano ~/rpmbuild/SPECS/kernel.spec
   ```

2. **Add Zen 4 Optimization Flags**:
   Append the following flags to the `%global optflags` in the SPEC file:
   ```text
   -march=znver4 -mtune=znver4
   ```

3. **Optional: Enable Zen Kernel Patches**:
   If you want additional performance patches, consider using the Zen kernel. Download the Zen patches from their Git repository and add them to the `~/rpmbuild/SOURCES/` directory. Then, update the SPEC file to include the patches.

#### **4. Build the Kernel**
1. **Prepare the Kernel Config**:
   Nobara uses a custom kernel configuration. Ensure the `.config` file is set up correctly:
   ```bash
   cd ~/rpmbuild/BUILD/kernel-*/linux-*
   cp /boot/config-$(uname -r) .config
   make olddefconfig
   ```

2. **Start the Build**:
   Build the kernel RPMs:
   ```bash
   rpmbuild -bb ~/rpmbuild/SPECS/kernel.spec
   ```

3. This process will take some time. If successful, the RPM files will appear in `~/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/`.

#### **5. Install the New Kernel**
1. Install the custom kernel RPM:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/kernel-*.rpm
   ```

2. Update the GRUB configuration:
   ```bash
   sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
   ```

3. Reboot and select the new kernel from the GRUB menu.

#### **6. Verify Optimization**
After booting into the new kernel:
1. Check the active kernel version:
   ```bash
   uname -r
   ```

2. Verify the optimizations:
   ```bash
   cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep -i flags
   ```
   Look for Zen 4-specific optimizations like `znver4`.

This process gives you a custom kernel optimized for Zen 4 on Nobara Linux. Let me know if you need assistance with any specific step!

     Open the spec file (`~/rpmbuild/SPECS/kernel.spec`) in an editor.
     ```bash
     nano ~/rpmbuild/SPECS/kernel.spec
     ```
     Look for the `make` commands in the `%build` section and append the following flags:
     ```text
     KCFLAGS="-march=znver4 -O2"
     ```
     For example:
     ```bash
     %define buildflags CFLAGS="$RPM_OPT_FLAGS -march=znver4" CXXFLAGS="$RPM_OPT_FLAGS -march=znver4"
     ```
   - **Enable LTO and PGO** (optional for performance):
     Add:
     ```text
     CONFIG_LTO=y
     CONFIG_PGO=y
     ```
     to your `.config` file or kernel build configuration.

#### 3. Customize Kernel Configuration (Optional)
   - Navigate to the kernel source directory:
     ```bash
     cd ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES/kernel-<version>
     ```
   - Customize the configuration:
     ```bash
     make menuconfig
     ```
   - Save the configuration file.

#### 4. Build the Kernel RPM
   ```bash
   rpmbuild -bb ~/rpmbuild/SPECS/kernel.spec
   ```

#### 5. Install the Kernel RPM
   After the build completes, install the new kernel:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/kernel-*.rpm
   ```

---

### Final Steps
- **Update GRUB**:
   ```bash
   sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
   ```
- **Reboot**:
   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   ```

---

### Notes
- Ensure all dependencies are installed to avoid build failures.
- Using Zen 4 optimizations (`-march=znver4`) is specific to AMD Ryzen 7000 series CPUs or similar with Zen 4 architecture.
- Regularly test the kernel to ensure stability.

2. **Edit the Kernel Spec File**:
   Open the spec file located in `~/rpmbuild/SPECS/kernel.spec`:
   ```bash
   nano ~/rpmbuild/SPECS/kernel.spec
   ```
   Look for `CFLAGS` and adjust it to include `-march=znver4`:
   ```spec
   %global optflags %{optflags} -march=znver4
   ```

3. **Download the Latest Kernel Source**:
   Replace Nobara's kernel source tarball with the version you want to use. You can download the latest vanilla Linux kernel from [kernel.org](https://www.kernel.org/). Place it in `~/rpmbuild/SOURCES/` and update the `.spec` file to match the new version.

4. **Patch the Kernel** (Optional):
   If Nobara applies specific patches, you can include them in the `kernel.spec` file under the `Patch` sections. Zen kernel patches might also be desirable for enhanced performance.

5. **Configure the Kernel**:
   Extract the kernel source and configure it:
   ```bash
   cd ~/rpmbuild/BUILD/kernel-*/linux-*
   cp /boot/config-$(uname -r) .config
   make menuconfig
   ```
   Make sure optimizations for Zen 4 are enabled in the `.config`. Look for options like:
   - `CONFIG_MCORE2=y` (ensure Zen-specific settings are applied).
   - Set the `Processor family` to `AMD Zen`.

6. **Build the Kernel RPM**:
   Return to the `rpmbuild` directory and build the RPM:
   ```bash
   rpmbuild -ba ~/rpmbuild/SPECS/kernel.spec
   ```
   This process will create the RPMs in `~/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/`.

7. **Install the Custom Kernel**:
   After the RPMs are built, install them using `dnf` or `rpm`:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/kernel-*.rpm
   ```

---

### **Post-Build Steps**
1. **Update GRUB**:
   ```bash
   sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
   ```
2. **Reboot** into the new kernel and verify:
   ```bash
   uname -r
   ```

---

### **Tips for Optimization**
- **Enable LTO (Link Time Optimization)**: Add `-flto` in the `CFLAGS` for further optimization.
- **Use GCC**: Ensure your compiler is optimized for AMD Zen 4; install the latest GCC version if necessary.
- **Test Performance**: Use tools like `phoronix-test-suite` to benchmark your custom kernel.

This will produce a Nobara-compatible kernel optimized for Zen 4.

## assistant

Building a custom kernel RPM for Nobara Linux with Zen 4 optimizations involves several steps. Nobara is based on Fedora, so Fedora's packaging system and tools (RPM and `rpmbuild`) will be used. Follow this guide:

---

### Prerequisites
1. **Install Required Packages**  
   Ensure you have the necessary tools installed:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install rpm-build gcc make ncurses-devel bison flex elfutils-libelf-devel openssl-devel grub2-tools
   ```

2. **Set Up RPM Build Environment**  
   Create and set up the build environment if not already done:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/rpmbuild/{BUILD,RPMS,SOURCES,SPECS,SRPMS}
   echo '%_topdir %(echo $HOME)/rpmbuild' > ~/.rpmmacros
   ```

3. **Download Nobara Kernel Source**  
   Clone the Nobara Linux kernel source or download the corresponding SRPM package:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf download --source kernel
   ```

4. **Unpack the Source RPM**  
   Use `rpm` to install the source RPM:
   ```bash
   rpm -ivh kernel-*.src.rpm
   cd ~/rpmbuild
   ```

---

### Kernel Customization
1. **Modify Kernel Configuration**  
   Locate the kernel configuration file in `~/rpmbuild/SOURCES`.  
   Add or adjust optimization flags for Zen 4 CPUs. Add the following to `CFLAGS` and `CXXFLAGS` in the kernel's configuration:
   ```bash
   -march=znver4
   ```

2. **Patch Kernel Spec File**  
   Edit the `kernel.spec` file in `~/rpmbuild/SPECS`:
   - Locate the `%build` section and append Zen 4 optimizations.
   - Ensure the `CFLAGS` and `CXXFLAGS` modifications are used during the build.

---

### Build Process
1. **Prepare Kernel Sources**  
   Apply patches and prepare the kernel sources:
   ```bash
   rpmbuild -bp SPECS/kernel.spec
   ```

2. **Build the Kernel**  
   Build the kernel RPM package:
   ```bash
   rpmbuild -bb SPECS/kernel.spec
   ```

   The resulting RPMs will be located in `~/rpmbuild/RPMS/`.

---

### Install the Custom Kernel
1. Install the newly built kernel:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/kernel-*.rpm
   ```

2. Update GRUB:
   ```bash
   sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
   ```

3. Reboot into the new kernel:
   ```bash
   reboot
   ```

---

### Testing & Validation
1. Verify that the system is running the custom kernel:
   ```bash
   uname -r
   ```

2. Check if the optimizations are in effect by monitoring performance and benchmarks.

Building a custom kernel RPM with Zen 4 optimizations for Nobara Linux 41 involves several steps. This assumes you have some familiarity with compiling kernels and using RPM packaging tools. Below are the detailed steps:

---

### Prerequisites

1. **Install Required Packages**  
   Ensure you have development tools and kernel build dependencies:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf groupinstall "Development Tools"
   sudo dnf install fedpkg ncurses-devel bison flex elfutils-libelf-devel openssl-devel dwarves bc gcc
   ```

2. **Set Up Environment**  
   Use a workspace directory for your build:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/rpmbuild/{SOURCES,SPECS,BUILD,RPMS,SRPMS}
   export RPMBUILD=~/rpmbuild
   ```

3. **Download Kernel Source**  
   Clone the Nobara kernel source or fetch the Fedora kernel source that Nobara customizes:
   ```bash
   fedpkg clone kernel
   cd kernel
   ```

---

### Customizing the Kernel for Zen 4

1. **Enable Zen 4 Optimizations**  
   Modify the kernel configuration for Zen 4-specific optimizations:
   - Open the kernel config:
     ```bash
     make menuconfig
     ```
   - Navigate to `Processor type and features` â†’ `Processor family`. Select `AMD Zen 4`.  
     Alternatively, manually set the `.config`:
     ```bash
     echo "CONFIG_MZEN4=y" >> .config
     ```

   - Set custom GCC optimization flags:
     Modify `Makefile` in the kernel source to add `-march=znver4 -mtune=znver4`:
     ```bash
     sed -i 's/-mtune=generic/-march=znver4 -mtune=znver4/' Makefile
     ```

2. **Update SPEC File**  
   Edit the `kernel.spec` file to include the custom build configuration. Look for the `%build` section and ensure your GCC flags are passed:
   ```spec
   %global optflags -march=znver4 -mtune=znver4
   ```

3. **Build Kernel RPM**  
   Use the RPM build tools to create the RPM packages:
   ```bash
   rpmbuild -bb --with baseonly kernel.spec
   ```

4. **Install the Kernel RPM**  
   Once the RPMs are built, install them using `dnf`:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/kernel-*.rpm
   ```

---

### Testing

1. **Update GRUB**  
   After installation, update the GRUB bootloader:
   ```bash
   sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
   ```

2. **Reboot and Select New Kernel**  
   Reboot your system and select the custom kernel in the GRUB menu.

3. **Verify Optimizations**  
   Check that the kernel is using the Zen 4 optimizations:
   ```bash
   dmesg | grep -i "cpu.*family"
   cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep "flags"
   ```

---

### Notes

- **Backup**: Always have a recovery option in case the new kernel fails to boot.
- **Debugging**: Use the `rescue` kernel or Nobara's default kernel for fallback.
- **Documentation**: Refer to Nobara and Fedora kernel development guides for specific patches.

howto build fedora linux 41 kernel dnf rpm with ryzen zen4 optimisation, how do i use znver4
## assistant

To build a Fedora Linux 41 kernel RPM optimized for Ryzen Zen 4 (`znver4`), you'll need to customize the kernel build process by specifying the `znver4` CPU optimization in the compilation flags. Here's a step-by-step guide:

---

### Prerequisites
1. **Install Required Tools**:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install fedpkg fedora-packager rpm-build gcc make elfutils-libelf-devel bc
   ```

2. **Set Up Your Build Environment**:
   Create a directory for RPM builds:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/rpmbuild/{BUILD,RPMS,SOURCES,SPECS,SRPMS}
   echo '%_topdir %(echo $HOME)/rpmbuild' > ~/.rpmmacros
   ```

---

### Steps to Build a Kernel RPM with `znver4`
#### 1. Download the Kernel Source RPM
```bash
fedpkg clone -a kernel
cd kernel
fedpkg prep
```

This will fetch and prepare the kernel source in the working directory.

#### 2. Modify Compiler Flags
Edit the `kernel.spec` file in the repository:
1. Search for the `%global optflags` section.
2. Append or replace the architecture-specific optimization with `-march=znver4`.

Example:
```bash
%global optflags -O2 -g -pipe -Wall -Werror=format-security -march=znver4
```

#### 3. Apply Changes to Configurations
Ensure the kernel's default `.config` supports your hardware:
```bash
cp config-x86_64 .config
make olddefconfig
```

#### 4. Build the Kernel
Build the RPM package with the updated flags:
```bash
fedpkg local
```

#### 5. Install the Custom Kernel
After building, youâ€™ll find the RPMs in the `~/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/` directory. Install them using:
```bash
sudo dnf install ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/kernel-*.rpm
```

---

### Verify the Optimization
1. Boot into the new kernel:
   - Select it from your boot manager.
   - Verify the running kernel:
     ```bash
     uname -r
     ```

2. Check for `znver4` optimizations:
   - Use `dmesg` or `cat /proc/cpuinfo` to ensure the kernel is optimized for Zen 4.

---

### Notes
- **Testing**: Verify stability and performance with benchmarking tools like `phoronix-test-suite`.
- **Maintenance**: Reapply these steps for every kernel update or new source release.
- **Risks**: Custom compilation may not be covered under Fedora's support. Proceed with caution on production systems.

Building the Fedora Linux 41 kernel RPM with Ryzen Zen 4 optimizations (`-march=znver4`) involves rebuilding the kernel package with custom compiler flags. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide:

---

### **Prerequisites**
1. **Ensure your system is up to date:**
   ```bash
   sudo dnf update
   ```

2. **Install necessary build tools:**
   ```bash
   sudo dnf groupinstall "Development Tools"
   sudo dnf install fedora-packager ncurses-devel bc flex bison elfutils-libelf-devel openssl-devel
   ```

3. **Install kernel source and tools:**
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install kernel kernel-devel kernel-headers
   sudo dnf builddep kernel
   ```

---

### **Step 1: Prepare the Build Environment**
1. **Set up RPM build directories:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/rpmbuild/{BUILD,RPMS,SOURCES,SPECS,SRPMS}
   echo '%_topdir %(echo $HOME)/rpmbuild' > ~/.rpmmacros
   ```

2. **Download the Fedora kernel source RPM:**
   ```bash
   dnf download --source kernel
   ```

3. **Extract the kernel source RPM:**
   ```bash
   rpm -ivh kernel-*.src.rpm
   ```

---

### **Step 2: Modify Build Configuration**
1. **Edit the kernel spec file:**
   Open `~/rpmbuild/SPECS/kernel.spec` in a text editor:
   ```bash
   nano ~/rpmbuild/SPECS/kernel.spec
   ```

2. **Add Zen 4 optimization flags:**
   Find the `%global optflags` line and append `-march=znver4`. For example:
   ```plaintext
   %global optflags -O2 -g -pipe -Wall -Werror=format-security -march=znver4
   ```

   Alternatively, you can add:
   ```plaintext
   %global optflags -O2 -pipe -Wall -march=znver4
   ```

---

### **Step 3: Rebuild the Kernel**
1. **Download additional sources:**
   If prompted for missing sources during the build process:
   ```bash
   spectool -g -R ~/rpmbuild/SPECS/kernel.spec
   ```

2. **Start the build process:**
   ```bash
   rpmbuild -bb ~/rpmbuild/SPECS/kernel.spec
   ```

---

### **Step 4: Install the Custom Kernel**
1. **Locate the RPMs:**
   After the build completes, find the RPMs in `~/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/`.

2. **Install the kernel RPMs:**
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/kernel-*.rpm
   ```

3. **Update the bootloader:**
   Grub should automatically detect the new kernel. If not, regenerate the Grub configuration:
   ```bash
   sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
   ```

4. **Reboot into the new kernel:**
   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   ```

---

### **Verify Zen 4 Optimizations**
1. **Check kernel version:**
   ```bash
   uname -r
   ```

2. **Ensure Zen 4 instructions are supported:**
   Use `cat /proc/cpuinfo` to verify if the kernel is optimized for Zen 4.

---

### **Tips**
- If you encounter errors during the build, review the log files in the `BUILD` directory.
- For frequent rebuilding, consider using `mock` for isolated builds:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install mock
   mock -r fedora-41-x86_64 --buildsrpm --spec ~/rpmbuild/SPECS/kernel.spec --sources ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES/
   ```

This process ensures your kernel is tailored to take full advantage of Zen 4 (`znver4`) optimizations.
