This code snippet is defining a Python regular expression pattern (`HEADER_RE`) using the `re.compile()` function from the `re` module. The pattern is designed to match and capture structured text, likely from a file that contains metadata separated by delimiters like `---` or `...`. Here's a breakdown of what each part does:

### Components of the Regular Expression

1. **`^---$`**: 
   - `^`: Asserts the position at the start of a line.
   - `---`: Matches exactly three hyphens.
   - `$`: Asserts the position at the end of a line.

   This part of the pattern matches a line consisting solely of `---`, which is often used as a delimiter.

2. **`(?P<metadata>.+?)`**:
   - `(?P<metadata>...)`: This is a named capturing group called `metadata`. The content that matches this group will be accessible via the name `metadata`.
   - `.+?`: Matches any character (`.`) one or more times (`+`), but as few times as possible (`?`), making this a non-greedy match. This part captures the metadata content.

3. **`^(?:---|\.\.\.)$`**:
   - `^` and `$`: Again, assert the start and end of a line.
   - `(?:---|\.\.\.)`: This is a non-capturing group (`?:`) that matches either three hyphens (`---`) or three dots (`...`). This line acts as the closing delimiter for the metadata section.

4. **`(?P<content>.*)`**:
   - `(?P<content>...)`: Another named capturing group called `content`. The content that matches this group will be accessible via the name `content`.
   - `.*`: Matches any character (`.`) zero or more times (`*`), capturing the remaining content after the metadata section.

### Flags
- **`re.MULTILINE`**: This flag allows `^` and `$` to match the start and end of each line, not just the start and end of the entire string.
- **`re.DOTALL`**: This flag allows the `.` (dot) to match any character, including newline characters.

### Example Use Case
This regular expression could be used to parse a file that is formatted as follows:

```yaml
---
title: My Document
author: Jane Doe
date: 2024-08-22
---
This is the content of the document.
It can span multiple lines.
```

Using this regular expression, the `metadata` group would capture:

```
title: My Document
author: Jane Doe
date: 2024-08-22
```

And the `content` group would capture:

```
This is the content of the document.
It can span multiple lines.
```

This pattern is common in formats like YAML front matter, which is often used in static site generators like Jekyll or Hugo.
