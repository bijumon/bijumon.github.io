## assistant

Meftal Forte contains mefenamic acid and paracetamol, used mainly for pain relief, including menstrual cramps, headaches, toothaches, and muscular pain. Here are some general guidelines, but it’s best to consult a doctor for specific instructions based on your condition:

1. **Dosage**: Typically, adults are prescribed 1 tablet 2-3 times a day, but the dosage can vary.
2. **Food Intake**: It’s generally advised to take Meftal Forte after meals to reduce stomach irritation.
3. **Water**: Take it with a full glass of water to ensure it absorbs well.

Avoid alcohol, and check for any possible interactions with other medications you may be taking. If you experience side effects like stomach pain, dizziness, or nausea, consult your healthcare provider.
