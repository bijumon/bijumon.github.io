how can i launch an app as a different user under wayland
## assistant

Launching an app as a different user under **Wayland** can be a bit trickier than under X11 due to tighter security and sandboxing, especially around display access and environment variables. Here's a breakdown of what you can and can't do, and how to work around it.

---

## üõë Why it's tricky under Wayland

Wayland **does not allow arbitrary clients** (like other users' processes) to connect to the compositor by default. Under X11, you could just `xhost +` or use `sudo -u otheruser app` and it would open ‚Äî but **Wayland prevents this by design**.

---

## ‚úÖ Possible Workarounds

### 1. **Use `machinectl shell` (systemd-nspawn)**
This is one of the safest and cleanest ways to run apps as another user under Wayland:

```bash
machinectl shell otheruser@ --setenv=DISPLAY=$DISPLAY --setenv=XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR
```

Then run your app inside the shell. This shares the environment needed for Wayland access **if the compositor supports it** (GNOME and KDE may still restrict it).

### 2. **Use `sudo` or `su` carefully (not recommended under Wayland)**
You can try:

```bash
sudo -u otheruser env DISPLAY=$DISPLAY XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR appname
```

But in practice, this **will almost always fail** under Wayland with an error like "Unable to connect to the Wayland display."

---

## üí° Best Practice: Use `Polkit` or Wrapper Scripts

For apps that **require privilege escalation** (like settings panels), desktops like GNOME and KDE use **Polkit** for secure privilege elevation. Instead of running the whole app as another user, consider:

- Using `pkexec` with GUI tools designed for it.
- Creating a wrapper script with proper `DBus` and `Wayland` permissions if needed.

---

## üß™ Experimental Option: Launch a nested Wayland session

You can use something like `weston` or `cage` to start a **nested Wayland compositor as the other user**, and run apps inside it:

```bash
sudo -u otheruser weston --socket=wayland-1 &
WAYLAND_DISPLAY=wayland-1 sudo -u otheruser appname
```

This works if the app supports nested Wayland properly.

---

## ‚úÖ Under KDE (Plasma Wayland)

KWin doesn't currently allow launching apps from other users into the main session unless that user is the same. If you're on KDE, the recommended way is to:

- Use a separate TTY session.
- Or run apps via Flatpak or containers where permissions can be managed.

---

## Summary

| Method | Works on Wayland? | Notes |
|-------|-------------------|-------|
| `sudo -u otheruser app` | ‚ùå | Likely to fail under Wayland |
| `machinectl shell` | ‚úÖ | Best bet if supported |
| Nested Weston session | ‚úÖ | Experimental but functional |
| `pkexec` / Polkit | ‚úÖ | For specific tools, not general apps |

---

If you have a specific app or goal in mind (e.g., file manager as root, launching a game as another user), I can suggest a tailored method for that case.
## user
give a couple of machinectl shell examples
## assistant
Sure! Here are a couple of **`machinectl shell`** examples for launching an app or getting a shell as another user ‚Äî including passing the necessary environment variables for Wayland compatibility.

---

### üîß **Example 1: Start a shell as another user and run a GUI app**

```bash
machinectl shell username@ --setenv=DISPLAY=$DISPLAY --setenv=XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR
```

Once you're in the shell, just run the app:

```bash
kate
```

This will run the app as `username` using the current Wayland session's environment.

---

### üß™ **Example 2: Directly run an app as another user (without full shell)**

```bash
machinectl shell username@ /usr/bin/env DISPLAY=$DISPLAY XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR firefox
```

This skips the interactive shell and just runs the command.

---

### üîê Requirements and Notes

- The user must exist on the system.
- `systemd` must be managing the user's session (which is typical).
- You may need to allow login or shell access via `loginctl enable-linger username`.
- Some desktop environments (like GNOME or KDE) might **still block** this depending on session permissions or compositor policies.

---

Let me know which desktop you're on (e.g., KDE, GNOME), and I can tailor this a bit more ‚Äî or help troubleshoot if the app doesn't show up.
