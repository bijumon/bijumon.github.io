The best frontend for LLMs on Linux depends on your specific use case (e.g., chat, coding, offline models, API integration). Here are some of the top choices:

### **1. Local GUI Apps**  
If you want a native GUI application for running local LLMs:  
- **KoboldCpp** â€“ Great for running local models with an interactive UI, focused on storytelling and general chat.  
- **LM Studio** â€“ A polished GUI that supports local models and APIs like OpenAI.  
- **GPT4All** â€“ A simple UI with local model support and API integration.  

### **2. Web-Based Frontends**  
For a browser-based experience:  
- **Text Generation WebUI** â€“ The most powerful UI for local LLMs, supports multiple backends like Llama.cpp, ExLlama, and KoboldCpp.  
- **Ollama** â€“ Simple command-line and web UI for running local models easily.  

### **3. Terminal-Based Interfaces**  
If you prefer a lightweight, command-line approach:  
- **llama.cpp** â€“ Efficient and fast, with basic CLI interaction.  
- **GPT4All (CLI mode)** â€“ A terminal interface for local models.  

### **4. Chatbot Frontends for APIs (OpenAI, Local, Hybrid)**  
- **Chatbot UI** â€“ A self-hosted UI similar to ChatGPT, can connect to OpenAI or local models.  
- **Open WebUI** â€“ Open-source ChatGPT-like UI with support for multiple LLM backends.  

### **Best Choice?**  
- **For local models:** Text Generation WebUI (if you want full control) or LM Studio (if you want simplicity).  
- **For an OpenAI-like experience:** Chatbot UI or Open WebUI.  
- **For terminal users:** llama.cpp or GPT4All CLI.
