in shell, replace the string '+++' exactly with '---', do not replace one, two or more than three '+++' but exactly three
## assistant

To replace exactly three consecutive `+` characters (`+++`) with three consecutive `-` characters (`---`), you can use the following `sed` command:

```bash
sed 's/\(^\|[^+]\)\+\+\+\([^+]\|$\)/\1---\2/g' inputfile
```

### Explanation:
- `s/old/new/g` - standard sed substitution syntax.
- `\(^\|[^+]\)\+\+\+\([^+]\|$\)` - matches exactly `+++` with boundaries on each side to ensure they aren't part of a longer sequence of `+`.
  - `\(^\|[^+]\)` - matches the start of a line or any character that's not a `+` before `+++`.
  - `\([^+]\|$\)` - matches any character thatâ€™s not a `+` or the end of a line after `+++`.

## assistant

You can use `sed` in the shell to replace exactly three `+` characters (`+++`) with three `-` characters (`---`) as follows:

```bash
sed 's/+++$/---/g' filename
```

Here's what each part of the command does:

- `s/+++$/---/g`: Looks for the pattern `+++` exactly and replaces it with `---`.
  
If you're using this on a string rather than a file, you can do:

```bash
echo "some +++ example ++++ text" | sed 's/+++$/---/g'
