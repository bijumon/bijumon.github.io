Your code checks whether a hand (probably a list or set of playing cards) contains an Ace (`'A'`) **and** one of the face cards (`'K'`, `'Q'`, `'J'`) or a ten (`'10'`). It can be simplified for clarity and efficiency:

### Simplified version:

```python
def has_blackjack(hand):
    return 'A' in hand and any(card in hand for card in ('K', 'Q', 'J', '10'))
```

### Explanation:
- `'A' in hand`: checks if there's

if 'A' in hand:

Here’s a cleaner and more Pythonic way to rewrite your code:

```python
return 'A' in hand and any(card in hand for card in ['K', 'Q', 'J', '10'])
```

This version uses a one-liner with a generator expression for readability and efficiency. Let me know if you'd like a version that’s more verbose or easier to read for beginners.
## assistant

Here's a cleaner and more Pythonic rewrite of your code:

```python
if 'A' in hand and any(card in hand for card in ['K', 'Q', 'J', '10']):
    return True
return False
```

Or even shorter as a one-liner:

```python
return 'A' in hand and any(card in hand for card in ['K', 'Q', 'J', '10'])
```

This version preserves the original logic: it returns True if there's an 'A' in hand and at least one of 'K', 'Q', 'J', or '10'.
## assistant

Here’s a cleaner and more Pythonic way to rewrite your code:

```python
def has_blackjack_face_card(hand):
    return 'A' in hand and any(card in hand for card in ['K', 'Q', 'J', '10'])
```

This version uses any() to check for the presence of any face card or 10, and returns the result directly. Let me know if you'd like it expanded with comments or made more general!
## user
rewrite without any

if 'A' in hand:
        if 'K' in hand or 'Q' in hand or 'J' in hand or '10' in hand:
            return True
        else:
            return False
    else:
        return False
## assistant

You can rewrite that logic without any if statements like this:

```python
return 'A' in hand and any(card in hand for card in ['K', 'Q', 'J', '10'])
```

This returns True if 'A' is in the hand and at least one of the other face cards or '10' is also present. Otherwise, it returns False.

rewrite without any()

if 'A' in hand:
        if 'K' in hand or 'Q' in hand or 'J' in hand or '10' in hand:
            return True
        else:
            return False
    else:
        return False
## assistant

Here's your code rewritten without any parentheses and using a more concise structure:

```python
if 'A' in hand:
    for face in ['K', 'Q', 'J', '10']:
        if face in hand:
            return True
    return False
return False
```

This version avoids using any parentheses and still preserves the original logic: return True if 'A' is in hand and at least one of 'K', 'Q', 'J', or '10' is also present.
## assistant

Here's your code rewritten without any parentheses and simplified using chained if-statements and Python's in keyword:

if 'A' in hand:
    if 'K' in hand or 'Q' in hand or 'J' in hand or '10' in hand:
        return True
    return False
return False

Alternatively, here's a cleaner version using a set for the face cards:

if 'A' in hand:
    if any(card in hand for card in ['K', 'Q', 'J', '10']):
        return True
return False

Let me know if you want it condensed to a one-liner or adapted for a function.
## assistant

You can collapse the nested `if`’s into a single Boolean expression (without using `any()`) like this:

```python
def has_ace_and_face_or_ten(hand):
    return 'A' in hand and ('K' in hand or 'Q' in hand or 'J' in hand or '10' in hand)
```

This returns `True` exactly when there’s an `'A'` in `hand` **and** at least one of `'K'`, `'Q'`, `'J'` or `'10'` is also present—otherwise it returns `False`.

rewrite to be pythonic


if 'A' in hand:
        if 'K' in hand or 'Q' in hand or 'J' in hand or '10' in hand:
            return True
        else:
            return False
    else:
        return False
## assistant

Here's a more Pythonic way to write that logic:

```python
def has_blackjack_face_card(hand):
    return 'A' in hand and any(card in hand for card in ['K', 'Q', 'J', '10'])
```

This version uses a generator expression with any(), which is cleaner, more concise, and idiomatic.
## user
rewrite 

return True if value_of_card(card_one) == value_of_card(card_two)
## assistant
You can rewrite that line more Pythonically as:

```python
return value_of_card(card_one) == value_of_card(card_two)
```

Since the expression already evaluates to a boolean, explicitly writing return True if ... is redundant.
