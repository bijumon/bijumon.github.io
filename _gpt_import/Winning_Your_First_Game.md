Winning your first game of **Civilization VI** can be challenging, but here’s a guide to help you get started and increase your chances of success.

### 1. **Start with the Tutorial**
   - The tutorial is designed to introduce you to the game mechanics. It will guide you through the basic steps like building cities, exploring, and managing your civilization. It’s an excellent starting point【4†source】.

### 2. **Choose the Right Difficulty**
   - If it’s your first game, start on the **Settler** difficulty. This is the easiest level and gives you significant advantages over the AI. As you become more comfortable, you can increase the difficulty in future games【4†source】.

### 3. **Pick a Civilization That Matches Your Playstyle**
   - Each civilization in Civ VI has unique abilities, units, and buildings. For a first game, you might choose a civ that has straightforward advantages. For example:
     - **Rome**: Excellent for beginners due to its powerful legions and free buildings in new cities.
     - **Greece**: Comes with extra policies and strong early-game military units【4†source】.

### 4. **Focus on Early Game Development**
   - **Exploration**: Use Scouts to explore the map quickly. This will help you find good locations for new cities and meet other civilizations and city-states.
   - **City Placement**: Settle cities near rivers or coasts for fresh water and growth bonuses. Look for resources that can be easily exploited to give your civilization an edge.
   - **Build a Strong Economy**: Prioritize building improvements that boost your food, production, and gold. This will enable your cities to grow faster and support a larger army【4†source】.

### 5. **Research and Culture**
   - **Technology**: Focus on technologies that improve your cities and military. Early technologies like **Animal Husbandry**, **Pottery**, and **Mining** are good starting points.
   - **Civics**: Civics like **Code of Laws** and **Foreign Trade** are essential for unlocking important policies and trade routes. Culture is as important as technology, so balance both【4†source】【4†source】.

### 6. **Military Defense and Offense**
   - **Defend Your Cities**: Always have a few military units stationed in or near your cities to protect against barbarians or surprise attacks from other civs.
   - **Conquer or Ally with Neighbors**: Decide early on whether to pursue a peaceful or aggressive strategy. If you choose to conquer, do so strategically, focusing on weaker neighbors or vital resources【4†source】.

### 7. **Diplomacy**
   - Engage in diplomacy with other civilizations. Trade resources, form alliances, and avoid unnecessary wars until you’re ready. Be mindful of the agendas of other leaders, as they can influence their behavior towards you【4†source】.

### 8. **Victory Conditions**
   - **Domination Victory**: Requires you to conquer all other capital cities.
   - **Cultural Victory**: Focus on creating great works and attracting tourists.
   - **Science Victory**: Develop your civilization technologically and be the first to launch a space mission.
   - **Religious Victory**: Convert the majority of the world’s population to your religion.
   - **Score Victory**: If the game reaches the final turn without any player achieving another victory type, the player with the highest score wins【4†source】.

### 9. **Use the Civilopedia**
   - The in-game Civilopedia is an excellent resource for detailed information on units, buildings, technologies, and more. Use it to answer specific questions that arise during your gameplay【4†source】.

By focusing on these key areas and learning as you go, you'll have a solid foundation to win your first game of Civilization VI. Enjoy the experience, and remember that each game will help you improve your strategy for the next!

What should I in the first 100 turns for a domination victory as rome julius

To achieve a **Domination Victory** as Rome under Julius Caesar in the first 100 turns, you'll want to prioritize early military expansion, efficient city management, and the strategic use of Rome's unique abilities. Here's a detailed guide on what to focus on:

### 1. **Understand Julius Caesar's Abilities**
   - **Leader Ability: Veni, Vidi, Vici** - You receive Gold each time you conquer a city for the first time. This is crucial for funding your early wars and maintaining your economy.
   - **Civilization Ability: All Roads Lead to Rome** - Cities you found or conquer start with a Trading Post and automatically build a road to the Capital, which boosts movement and trade. This helps you move troops quickly to the front lines.

### 2. **Early Game Priorities (Turns 1-50)**

#### **Turn 1-10: Set Up Your Capital**
   - **Scout First**: Build a Scout to explore your surroundings and find other civilizations, city-states, and good city locations.
   - **Warrior**: After the Scout, produce a Warrior to prepare for early conflicts and defense against barbarians.
   - **Research Animal Husbandry or Mining**: These technologies will reveal horses or help you access crucial resources for your early military units.

#### **Turn 11-20: Expand Quickly**
   - **Second City**: Start producing a Settler once your capital is strong enough. Settle near strategic resources like Horses or Iron to boost your military production.
   - **Builder**: A Builder can improve key tiles, like those with resources or high-yield tiles, to boost city growth and production.
   - **Early Military**: Start training Slingers (to upgrade into Archers) or Warriors, depending on available resources.

#### **Turn 21-50: Early Warfare and Expansion**
   - **Upgrade Units**: As soon as you research Archery, upgrade your Slingers to Archers. Use Gold from Caesar's ability to fund these upgrades.
   - **Barbarian Camps**: Clear Barbarian Camps for Gold and experience. Use them to train your units before engaging other civilizations.
   - **Conquer a Neighbor**: Identify the weakest nearby civilization and start a war. Use your Archers and Warriors to capture cities, focusing on the capital first.
   - **Build Encampments**: In your cities, construct Encampments to enhance your military production and give you a stronger defense.
   - **Trade Roads**: Take advantage of Rome's ability to automatically build roads between cities to move your troops quickly.

### 3. **Mid-Game Priorities (Turns 51-100)**

#### **Turn 51-70: Consolidate Gains**
   - **Build More Units**: As you expand, continuously produce military units in all cities. Aim to have a mix of melee units (like Swordsmen) and ranged units (like Archers).
   - **Maintain Economy**: Use the Gold from conquests to maintain and upgrade your army. Build Commercial Hubs to boost your economy if necessary.
   - **Policies**: Adopt policies that support your military efforts, such as *Agoge* (for increased production of melee units) and *Conscription* (to reduce unit maintenance costs).

#### **Turn 71-100: Prepare for the Next Wave**
   - **Target the Next Civilization**: With your first target down, look for the next nearby civilization to conquer. Move your troops into position, using Rome’s roads to expedite movement.
   - **Upgrade to Swordsmen**: As soon as you have Iron and research the necessary tech, upgrade your Warriors to Swordsmen. This will give you a significant advantage in battle.
   - **Build Siege Units**: Start producing Siege units like Catapults to help you take down stronger cities with walls.

### 4. **Tips for Success**
   - **City Management**: Focus on building Barracks in Encampments and increasing production in all your cities to maintain a steady flow of military units.
   - **Diplomacy**: Be mindful of other civilizations forming alliances against you. Use diplomacy to keep some civs friendly or to isolate your next target.
   - **Great Generals**: Try to earn or recruit a Great General to give your troops an edge in combat.

### 5. **Key Techs and Civics**
   - **Military Techs**: Prioritize Bronze Working (for Iron and Swordsmen), Iron Working, and Masonry (for walls).
   - **Civics**: Military Tradition (for flanking bonuses) and State Workforce (for Governors and policy slots) are essential early civics to boost your military efforts.

### Conclusion
By focusing on these strategies within the first 100 turns, you should be well on your way to a Domination Victory as Julius Caesar. Remember to keep the pressure on other civilizations, continuously expand your empire through conquest, and leverage Rome's strengths to maintain military dominance throughout the game.
