Dear Friends,

I am writing to you today with a very concerning issue. It has recently come to my attention that someone has created a fake Facebook profile using my name, and they are using it to ask for money. I want to inform you all that this profile is NOT me, and I am in no way asking for any sort of financial assistance on social media.

I urge you all to please be cautious of any messages or requests you receive from this fake profile. Do not send any money, as it is not me who is making these requests. Instead, I ask that you report this profile to Facebook immediately, so that appropriate action can be taken to remove it from the platform.

Identity theft and online scams are becoming increasingly common, and it is essential that we all take steps to protect ourselves from these kinds of fraudulent activities. Please do your part by reporting any suspicious behavior to the appropriate authorities.

Thank you for your understanding and support in this matter.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
