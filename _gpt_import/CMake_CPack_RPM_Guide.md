How can I use cmake in https://github.com/eXpl0it3r/libnoise to create a cpack rpm
## assistant

To use CMake in the `libnoise` repository to create an RPM package with CPack, you can follow these steps:

1. **Modify CMakeLists.txt:** Ensure that your `CMakeLists.txt` includes the necessary CPack configuration. Add the following lines:
   ```cmake
   include(CPack)
   set(CPACK_GENERATOR "RPM")
   set(CPACK_PACKAGE_NAME "libnoise")
   set(CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION "1.0.0")
   set(CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_RELEASE "1")
   set(CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_LICENSE "LGPL-2.1")
   ```

2. **Build the Project:**
   ```bash
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ```

3. **Generate the RPM:**
   ```bash
   cpack
   ```

This will create an RPM package in the `build` directory.

To create an RPM package using CPack for the `libnoise` library, follow these general steps:

1. **CMake Configuration**: Ensure that your `CMakeLists.txt` is configured to enable CPack. Add the following lines to `CMakeLists.txt`:
   ```cmake
   include(CPack)
   ```

2. **CPack Configuration**: Define CPack settings for RPM in `CMakeLists.txt`:
   ```cmake
   set(CPACK_GENERATOR "RPM")
   set(CPACK_PACKAGE_NAME "libnoise")
   set(CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION "1.0.0")
   set(CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_LICENSE "LGPL-2.1")
   set(CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_RELEASE "1")
   ```

3. **Build**: Run the following commands to build and generate the RPM:
   ```bash
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   cpack
   ```

This process will generate an RPM package for `libnoise`.

extract a source rpm
## assistant
To extract a source RPM (SRPM), you can use the following command:

```bash
rpm2cpio package.src.rpm | cpio -idmv
```

This will unpack the SRPM into its constituent files, such as the spec file, source tarballs, and patches, into the current directory.
