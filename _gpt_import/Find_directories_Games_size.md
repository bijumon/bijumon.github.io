in linux, find all subdirs name Games or "My games" and show their size
## assistant

To find all subdirectories named "Games" or "My games" and display their sizes in Linux, you can use the `find` command in combination with `du`. Here is how you can do it:

```sh
find /path/to/search -type d \( -name "Games" -o -name "My games" \) -exec du -sh {} +
```

Explanation of the command:

1. `find /path/to/search` - This initiates the search in the specified path. Replace `/path/to/search` with the directory you want to search within. Use `/` if you want to search the entire filesystem.

2. `-type d` - This ensures that only directories are considered in the search.

3. `\( -name "Games" -o -name "My games" \)` - This specifies the name patterns to match. It looks for directories named "Games" or "My games". The `\(` and `\)` are used to group the name conditions, and `-o` stands for "or".

4. `-exec du -sh {} +` - This part executes the `du -sh` command on each found directory. `du -sh` calculates the size of the directory in a human-readable format. The `{}` is replaced by the found directory path, and `+` is used to handle multiple directories at once.

This command will find all subdirectories named "Games" or "My games" starting from the specified path and will display their sizes. If you need to search the entire filesystem, replace `/path/to/search` with `/`. Be cautious when running such commands with root privileges, as they may traverse sensitive system directories.

To find all subdirectories named `Games` or `My games` and show their size in Linux, you can use a combination of the `find` and `du` commands. Here is a command that accomplishes this:

```sh
find /path/to/search -type d \( -name "Games" -o -name "My games" \) -exec du -sh {} +
```

Explanation:
- `find /path/to/search`: Starts the search from `/path/to/search`. Replace `/path/to/search` with the actual path where you want to start the search (e.g., `/home/user`).
- `-type d`: Searches for directories only.
- `\( -name "Games" -o -name "My games" \)`: Finds directories named `Games` or `My games`.
- `-exec du -sh {} +`: For each directory found, executes the `du -sh` command to show its size in a human-readable format.

For example, if you want to search from the root directory, you would use:

```sh
find / -type d \( -name "Games" -o -name "My games" \) -exec du -sh {} +
```

You can run this command in the terminal. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access all directories, or use `sudo` if required:

```sh
sudo find / -type d \( -name "Games" -o -name "My games" \) -exec du -sh {} +
```
