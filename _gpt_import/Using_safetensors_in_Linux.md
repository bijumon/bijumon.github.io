how can i use safetensor in linux
## assistant

Using `.safetensors` files in Linux depends on what you're trying to do with them. These files are commonly used in machine learning and AI workflows, especially with models from Hugging Face or Stable Diffusion.

Here‚Äôs a quick guide to using `.safetensors` in Linux:

---

## üîß 1. **Install the `safetensors` Python package**
This package lets you read and write `.safetensors` files.

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
pip install safetensors
```

If you're using a virtual environment or `conda`, make sure it's activated first.

---

## üìñ 2. **Read a `.safetensors` file**

Here's a basic Python example:

```python
from safetensors import safe_open

with safe_open("model.safetensors", framework="pt", device="cpu") as f:
    for key in f.keys():
        tensor = f.get_tensor(key)
        print(key, tensor.shape)
```

- `framework="pt"` is for PyTorch (can also be `"tf"` for TensorFlow).
- `device="cpu"` or `"cuda"` if you want to load it to the GPU.

---

## üß† 3. **Use with PyTorch**

If you‚Äôre loading a model checkpoint:

```python
import torch
from safetensors.torch import load_file

tensors = load_file("model.safetensors")
model.load_state_dict(tensors)
```

Make sure your model architecture matches the checkpoint.

---

## üé® 4. **Use with Stable Diffusion / Diffusers (Hugging Face)**

You can load safetensors models via `diffusers`:

```bash
pip install diffusers transformers
```

Then in Python:

```python
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline

pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(
    "model-directory",
    torch_dtype=torch.float16,
    variant="fp16",
    use_safetensors=True
)
```

---

## üîí Why `.safetensors`?

It‚Äôs a safe, fast, and secure alternative to PyTorch `.pt` files. No arbitrary code execution risk.

---

If you're using a specific model (like Stable Diffusion, LLaMA, etc.), let me know and I can tailor the usage more closely to that!

can i use it with llm, vllm, ollama, llama-cpp or ramalama
## assistant
Great question! Let‚Äôs break down `.safetensors` support across the most common LLM frameworks you're likely referencing: **LLM (generic), vLLM, Ollama, llama.cpp**, and‚Äîjokingly or not‚Äî**Ramalama** üòÑ

---

## ‚úÖ 1. **LLM (Generic, e.g., Hugging Face Transformers)**
Yes, `.safetensors` is **fully supported**.

If you're using `transformers`:

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    "path-or-model-name",
    trust_remote_code=True  # if needed
)
```

Transformers automatically detects and uses `.safetensors` if available.

---

## ‚úÖ 2. **vLLM**
Yes, **vLLM supports `.safetensors`**, but with some constraints.

To use:

```bash
pip install vllm
```

Then run:

```bash
python -m vllm.entrypoints.openai.api_server \
    --model path-to-model \
    --tokenizer path-to-tokenizer
```

If the model uses `.safetensors`, vLLM can handle it **as long as it‚Äôs compatible with Hugging Face Transformers format**. Make sure the model has a `config.json` and tokenizer files.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è 3. **Ollama**
Currently, **Ollama does not use `.safetensors`**. It uses a custom binary format that‚Äôs precompiled into GGUF or similar formats for llama.cpp.

So:  
üü• **No safetensors support** in Ollama.  
Models must be in GGUF, often converted from original formats.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è 4. **llama.cpp**
Same as Ollama:  
üü• **llama.cpp does not support `.safetensors`** directly.

It uses `GGUF` models (which are quantized for efficiency). To use a `.safetensors` model with llama.cpp, you'd need to **convert it to GGUF** using tools like:

- [`transformers` to convert ‚Üí PyTorch `.bin` or `.safetensors`](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/blob/master/examples/convert.py)
- Then convert `.bin` ‚Üí `.gguf` via llama.cpp‚Äôs Python tools or `convert.py`.

---

## üêë 5. **Ramalama**  
OK, this one sounds like a joke‚Äîunless you‚Äôre launching an open source LLM project with a killer name. In that case, I‚Äôm **fully on board** to help you build it üòÑ

## TL;DR

| Framework     | `.safetensors` Support | Notes                                                                 |
|---------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Transformers  | ‚úÖ Yes                 | Native support                                                       |
| vLLM          | ‚úÖ Yes                 | Works with Hugging Face-format models                                |
| Ollama        | ‚ùå No                  | Uses GGUF only                                                       |
| llama.cpp     | ‚ùå No                  | Use GGUF models; convert if needed                                   |

## user
how about llm cli
## assistant
Ah, you're talking about the [`llm`](https://llm.datasette.io/) CLI tool by [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/) ‚Äî the one that makes working with local and hosted LLMs super easy via the command line. Love that tool. üõ†Ô∏è

---

## üß† Does `llm` support `.safetensors`?

### ‚ùå Not directly.

The `llm` CLI is **backend-agnostic**, but **it doesn't load `.safetensors` models itself**. Instead, it relies on plugins that **wrap around backends** like:

- OpenAI
- Hugging Face (via API)
- Local models via `llm-llama-cpp`
- Cloud services

If you want to run `.safetensors`-based models locally, it depends on the plugin used.

---

### üîå Plugin Status for `.safetensors`:

#### 1. **`llm-llama-cpp`**  
‚û°Ô∏è Based on `llama.cpp` ‚Üí ‚ùå No `.safetensors`, GGUF only.

You can still **convert models** like this:

```bash
# Use Hugging Face Transformers to convert safetensors to PyTorch .bin
# Then llama.cpp to quantize it into GGUF
```

#### 2. **`llm-gpt4all`**  
Also uses GGUF/GGML-based models ‚Üí ‚ùå No `.safetensors` directly.

#### 3. **Custom local models (via `llm install ...`)**  
Unless the plugin specifically uses Hugging Face Transformers or PyTorch directly, `.safetensors` support will be limited.

---

## ‚úÖ Workaround: Use `.safetensors` in a Python backend

If you're set on `.safetensors`, you'd be better off:

1. Using Hugging Face `transformers` directly with `AutoModel*`.
2. Wrapping that in an OpenAI-compatible API server (e.g., `vLLM`, `text-generation-webui`, or `FastAPI`).
3. Then point `llm` to that API.

Example:

```bash
llm config set openai.api_base http://localhost:8000/v1
llm config set openai.api_key sk-local-123
```

Then you can run:

```bash
llm -m gpt4all "Tell me a joke about quantum computing"
```

Even if the backend is using your `.safetensors` model.

---

## TL;DR

| Backend        | `.safetensors` Support in `llm` CLI |
|----------------|--------------------------------------|
| `llm` core     | ‚ùå No                                |
| `llm-llama-cpp`| ‚ùå No (GGUF only)                    |
| `vLLM` (custom)| ‚úÖ Yes, if wrapped into API server   |
| Hugging Face API | ‚úÖ Yes, hosted models only          |
