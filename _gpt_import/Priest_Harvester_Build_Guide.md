For a strong **Priest of Berath** (Harvester of Gaun) build in *Pillars of Eternity II*, you'll want to focus on skills and abilities that complement both their healing and damage-dealing potential. This build will leverage the priest's divine power with the flexibility to handle both crowd control and healing. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the active and passive skills:

### Active Skills
1. **Arcana**:  
   - Invest heavily in Arcana, which enhances the use of scrolls, allowing your priest to cast additional spells, supporting the team with versatility and extra damage or healing options.
   - Arcana is especially useful for a priest to handle the need for situational spells without relying solely on their spell slots.

2. **Athletics**:  
   - This skill provides the *Second Wind* ability, restoring some health in a pinch. While priests typically stay back, they may take damage occasionally.
   - Invest at least 1–2 points early on. It’s not critical to max out, but a bit of Athletics can be a good emergency tool.

3. **Alchemy**:  
   - Although not essential, Alchemy increases the potency of consumables. This can be helpful if you want to use potions to enhance the priest’s performance in tough battles.
   - If you often rely on potions or would like to maximize certain effects, place some points here. Otherwise, this skill is optional and can be kept minimal.

### Passive Skills
1. **History**:
   - History not only helps in dialogue and lore but also works thematically for a priest of Gaun. With high History, your character can offer unique insights related to the soul and death lore, adding depth to roleplay elements.
   - Aim to raise it moderately high for the extra dialogue options and interactions.

2. **Insight**:
   - Insight offers unique dialogue options that fit well with a character rooted in divine understanding and empathy. It allows the priest to respond wisely in situations and improves interactions.
   - Recommended if you want to bring out the wisdom of Gaun’s priest in conversations. Invest a few points here as you level up.

3. **Religion**:
   - A must-have for any priest, Religion improves interactions with other religious characters and grants unique dialogue options. It ties into the priest’s core identity and strengthens their divine role in the party.
   - Max this out as high as possible for flavor, roleplaying, and additional quest interactions.

### General Skill Allocation Tips
- **Priority Order**: Focus first on Arcana and Religion for direct combat and roleplay benefits, followed by Insight and History. Athletics should get a few early points but isn’t a primary investment.
- **Balance**: Distribute points so that you have enough Religion and Arcana to support both in-combat abilities and dialogue, while secondary points can go to History and Insight for flavor and options.

This setup will ensure that your priest remains versatile and impactful, blending combat utility, thematic depth, and roleplaying opportunities. Let me know if you'd like to explore specific ability choices within the priest spells and combat abilities as well!

For a Priest of Berath focusing on the "Harvester of Gaun" theme in *Pillars of Eternity II*, you'll want a build that balances casting powerful spells, providing party support, and engaging effectively in melee combat to honor the reaping, death-focused aspect of Gaun. Since you're specifically interested in skills like *Alchemy*, *Athletics*, and other non-combat skills, let's look at how these can support your Priest's versatility and theme.

### General Build Concept
The "Harvester of Gaun" is a thematic Priest build that maximizes both support capabilities and melee viability. While most Priests are strong in the backline, the Harvester has a grim, reaping aesthetic, emphasizing balance between casting and combat prowess.

### Attributes
Attributes can be adjusted based on your exact playstyle, but here are recommendations that support both spells and melee:
- **Might**: High (15-18) - Increases spell and melee damage/healing.
- **Intellect**: High (15-18) - Extends AoE range and buff durations.
- **Dexterity**: Moderate (10-12) - A bit of Dexterity helps reduce casting time, but it’s not as critical as Might and Intellect.
- **Constitution**: Moderate (10-12) - Provides a bit of resilience.
- **Perception**: Moderate (10-12) - Useful for accuracy in melee, but not essential.
- **Resolve**: Low-Moderate (8-10) - Optional. Can be left lower if not tanking.

### Skills for the Harvester of Gaun
In *Pillars of Eternity II*, skills like **Alchemy**, **Athletics**, **Insight**, and **Religion** are powerful for priests, especially for one who toggles between spellcasting and melee combat. Here’s how each skill could work for a Harvester of Gaun:

#### Active Skills
1. **Alchemy**: **High Priority**  
   Alchemy is valuable here because it boosts the effectiveness of consumables, such as healing potions or damage-increasing drugs. This is especially helpful when you’re balancing both spellcasting and frontline combat, where you may occasionally need a boost.

2. **Athletics**: **Moderate Priority**  
   Athletics is beneficial for any character taking melee hits because it provides *Second Wind*, a self-heal ability that scales with skill level. A medium to high investment in Athletics can help you maintain your health during extended battles, particularly useful if you’re engaging in melee.

3. **Arcana**: **Optional**  
   Arcana allows the Priest to use powerful scrolls, which can be useful when you want to supplement your spells or cover certain weaknesses (like AoE damage). It’s not necessary but can be helpful for versatility if you find yourself using scrolls frequently.

#### Passive Skills
1. **Religion**: **High Priority**  
   Religion improves dialogue checks for Priests and strengthens thematic consistency for a Priest of Gaun. Additionally, it can give insights in dialogues and scripted interactions that are highly relevant to a death-focused Priest.

2. **Insight**: **Moderate Priority**  
   Insight enhances your ability to read emotions and intentions, which fits well for a Priest. Though not combat-related, Insight checks can be valuable in dialogues and scripted encounters, especially in handling tricky situations without resorting to violence.

3. **Survival**: **Moderate Priority**  
   Survival is versatile, offering resting bonuses that can boost healing, defenses, or accuracy. It’s more useful if you want to make camping in hostile areas less challenging, and it can improve your sustain between battles if you’re in the frontlines often.

### Playstyle Tips
- **Buff Before Battle**: As a Priest, you’ll have access to powerful buffing spells (like *Blessing*, *Armor of Faith*, and *Dire Blessing*). Use these to enhance your combat prowess and keep yourself and allies resilient.
  
- **Melee and Cast Interchangeably**: Use spells to weaken enemies at range, then close in to finish weakened foes with melee attacks, making sure you make the most out of Might-enhanced damage.

- **Consumables for Versatility**: With high Alchemy, consider using consumables like *Burned Moth Wing* for extra protection or damage boosts in critical moments.

This build captures the Harvester’s thematic role as both a reaper and a healer, blending Priest versatility with durable frontline support.

which abilities should i take
## assistant
For a *Priest of Berath* in *Pillars of Eternity II* with a focus on the "Harvester of Gaun" theme, you’ll want abilities that emphasize both the priestly role as a death-focused healer and reaper, with strong self-buffing, crowd control, and AoE potential. This allows your character to be flexible in casting support spells for the party, handling enemies, and dealing solid melee damage.

Here’s a breakdown of recommended abilities by power level, focusing on those that will help you reap, support, and survive:

---

### Power Level 1
1. **Restore**: A straightforward healing ability that helps keep allies alive in a pinch.
2. **Armor of Faith**: Grants damage reduction to all allies. Useful to buff your team early, especially if you’re on the frontlines.
3. **Spiritual Weapon**: Summons a *Great Sword*, which is very thematic and provides a reliable melee option that scales with your Might and Priest spells.

### Power Level 2
1. **Consecrated Ground**: Creates a healing field that persists over time, providing sustained healing in close combat.
2. **Suppress Affliction**: Removes harmful status effects from your party, invaluable for tough encounters, particularly when crowd control is heavy.
3. **Divine Terror**: Fear AoE spell that works well for crowd control, fitting your “reaper” theme by scattering or intimidating weaker foes.

### Power Level 3
1. **Holy Meditation**: Provides immunity to *Intellect Afflictions* (charm, confusion), which can be particularly helpful for you as a frontliner who needs to avoid debuffs.
2. **Dire Blessing**: Grants an accuracy bonus and the possibility of crits on your team, enhancing damage across the board.
3. **Shining Beacon**: A great debuff for enemies, reducing their defenses and dealing raw damage over time. This is especially helpful for “reaping” groups of weaker enemies.

### Power Level 4
1. **Minor Intercession**: Restores a moderate amount of health and removes afflictions from all allies. This is a great emergency heal to keep everyone in fighting shape.
2. **Circle of Protection**: A strong defensive spell that raises defenses for all allies within the area. This adds to your resilience as a melee-support Priest.
3. **Litany for the Spirit**: Increases *Perception*, *Intellect*, and *Resolve* for allies, boosting accuracy, defense, and spell duration.

### Power Level 5
1. **Champion's Boon**: Great for self-buffing, as it provides a large Might, Constitution, and Resolve boost. Use it on yourself for frontlining or on a key ally in combat.
2. **Salvation of Time**: Extends the duration of buffs on allies, including your own. This lets you keep your beneficial effects up longer, especially useful with lingering AoE abilities.
3. **Barring Death’s Door**: Prevents a teammate from dying when they’re reduced to 0 health. Essential for keeping your party in the fight.

### Power Level 6
1. **Wall of Draining**: An amazing choice for high-level priests. It drains beneficial effects from enemies while extending your own and your allies’ buffs. If used strategically, it can give you massive uptime on powerful abilities.
2. **Revive the Fallen**: An AoE revive that brings unconscious allies back into the fight. This is especially powerful if you’re taking a beating on the frontlines.
3. **Cleansing Flame**: A powerful debuff that burns and spreads to nearby enemies, helping to control groups of enemies and thematically acting like a “purging” fire.

### Power Level 7
1. **Devotions for the Faithful**: Grants *Might*, *Accuracy*, and *Resolve* to all allies within range, empowering your team and keeping with the idea of a “divine reaper” guiding the party.
2. **Hand of Weal and Woe**: Balances offensive and defensive power, boosting allies and dealing damage to enemies. Perfect for both crowd control and theme.
3. **Symbol of Berath**: An AoE that deals damage and dazes enemies. It’s a great tool for softening up groups and fits well for a Harvester-themed Priest, as Berath’s symbol reinforces the idea of mortality.

### Power Level 8
1. **Salvation of Time** (again): If possible, you’ll want to max this out since it remains immensely valuable for increasing the duration of all your buffs.
2. **Litany Against the Spirit**: A specialized ability that provides significant resistance to Intellect and Resolve afflictions, helping protect against charm, confusion, and fear effects.
  
### Power Level 9
1. **Storm of Holy Fire**: Deals massive AoE burn damage, fitting the destructive side of a Priest of Gaun as a reaper.
2. **Incarnate**: Summons a large spectral weapon to fight with you. This emphasizes your role as a divine reaper in close quarters, adding extra damage potential.

---

### Key Tips for Playstyle
- **Buff and Engage**: Open most encounters by buffing yourself and allies with spells like *Armor of Faith* and *Consecrated Ground*. Position yourself in melee range to take advantage of your durability and self-healing abilities.
- **Mix Spells and Strikes**: While you can handle melee well, remember to interweave spells to debuff or control enemies.
- **Healing and Restoration**: Be proactive with healing spells like *Minor Intercession* and *Consecrated Ground*. This ensures you maintain a strong frontline presence even while trading blows with the enemy.

This ability selection will make you a capable battle-priest, able to wade into melee and strike fear into enemies while keeping your allies strong and safe. The Harvester of Gaun build will balance reaping and healing, blending Priest powers with a touch of grim, divine retribution.

A "Harvester of Gaun" build in *Pillars of Eternity II* focuses on using the priest subclass "Eothasian Priest," which aligns with Eothas, the god of rebirth and harvest. This subclass has strengths in healing, support, and crowd control, making it ideal for a supportive caster role. However, with the right skill allocation, it can be geared for effective melee combat as well. Here’s a detailed guide on building a *Harvester of Gaun*, focusing specifically on the choice of active and passive skills.

### 1. **Core Build Concept**
   - **Role**: Support, crowd control, off-tank, or secondary melee damage dealer.
   - **Weapon**: Spears, flails, or staves (Eothas-themed weapons, often linked with the Harvester of Gaun concept). These work well for melee priests and can also contribute to healing when combined with certain passives.
   - **Armor**: Medium to light armor for balance between casting speed and survivability.

### 2. **Stat Allocation** (Prioritize)
   - **Intellect**: Maximizes area of effect and duration of spells.
   - **Might**: Boosts healing and damage output.
   - **Constitution**: Useful for survivability, especially if you plan to go into melee often.
   - **Dexterity**: Speeds up casting time but is secondary to the above stats.

### 3. **Active Skills**
   Active skills provide out-of-combat benefits but can also impact certain in-combat abilities. Here are the active skills I’d recommend focusing on for this build:

   - **Alchemy**: Moderate Priority
     - Alchemy boosts the effects of consumables like potions and drugs. This can be handy for enhancing survivability or spell output during tough fights, especially since priests tend to burn through their spells quickly in tough encounters.

   - **Athletics**: Moderate Priority
     - Athletics provides a bit of extra Health per rest and allows you to use "Second Wind" to heal yourself in combat. This is helpful for a Harvester of Gaun, who may find themselves in close range of enemies and need quick self-sustain.

   - **Explosives**: Low Priority
     - This is a niche choice but can work for priests who want to add extra crowd control or AOE damage when spells are exhausted. It’s more situational for this build, but if you like setting traps or adding extra effects, it can be a fun secondary choice.

### 4. **Passive Skills**
   Passives are crucial for enhancing combat and out-of-combat effectiveness. For a Harvester of Gaun, here are the top passive skills:

   - **Arcana**: High Priority
     - Priests often utilize scrolls for additional utility, especially when their spells are depleted. Arcana boosts your effectiveness with scrolls, adding a layer of versatility and backup spells.

   - **History**: Moderate Priority
     - This skill is valuable in dialogues and specific encounters, allowing you to leverage your priest’s religious background and lore expertise. It’s not essential for combat but provides good roleplay potential.

   - **Insight**: Moderate Priority
     - Insight helps in dialogues by providing a deeper understanding of NPC motivations. While it doesn’t directly impact combat, it can enhance the narrative experience of playing a priest of Eothas, who often seeks to understand and redeem others.

   - **Religion**: High Priority
     - Religion skill directly enhances your priest character’s lore and can unlock dialogue options, quests, or bonuses, especially when interacting with religious entities or followers of Eothas. This skill enriches the priest's role-playing experience, making it an important thematic choice.

### 5. **Recommended Skill Progression**
   As you level up, focus primarily on **Arcana** and **Religion** to maintain effectiveness in casting and lore interactions. Once these reach a comfortable level, spread points into **Alchemy** and **Athletics** to support combat sustain and consumable effectiveness.

This build will let you excel as a versatile support or off-tank priest who can contribute meaningfully in dialogue and lore interactions, making the *Harvester of Gaun* feel both effective and thematically rich. Let me know if you'd like advice on specific abilities to complete the build!

- **Martial Power** (Multi-Class Only): If you multiclass with a fighter or similar melee class, *Martial Power* boosts your melee capabilities significantly, though it sacrifices spellcasting speed.
  
---

### **Specific Multiclass Synergies (Optional)**

If you’re interested in multiclassing, a *Priest/Fighter* (Swashbuckler) or *Priest/Paladin* (Templar) multiclass can be very powerful:

- **Fighter Multiclass (Swashbuckler)**: Gives access to passive healing and tanking options (such as Constant Recovery) and can make the priest sturdier in melee.
- **Paladin Multiclass (Templar)**: Offers access to Lay on Hands, Flames of Devotion (great for added damage and healing), and various passives that improve survivability and synergy with your priest spells.

---

### **Ability Progression Overview**

**Early Levels**: Focus on foundational support abilities (like *Blessing*, *Holy Radiance*, *Consecrated Ground*).

**Mid Levels**: Add utility abilities (like *Devotions for the Faithful*, *Revive the Fallen*) that boost your allies and keep them alive in critical moments.
