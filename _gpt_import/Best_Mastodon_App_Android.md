## assistant

The best Mastodon app for Android depends on your preferences, but here are the **top picks** as of 2025:

### **1. Tusky**
- **Best for**: Most users
- **Pros**: Open source, clean interface, highly customizable, well-maintained
- **Cons**: No multi-account support (yet), lacks some advanced features

### **2. Megalodon**
- **Best for**: People who want advanced features (based on Tusky)
- **Pros**: Fork of Tusky with features like polls, full emoji reactions, and federated timeline
- **Cons**: Not on Play Store (F-Droid or sideload only)

### **3. Fedilab**
- **Best for**: Power users who want all-in-one support for Mastodon, Pleroma, etc.
- **Pros**: Multi-account, scheduled posts, advanced filters
- **Cons**: UI is more complex/clunky compared to others

### **4. Subway Tooter**
- **Best for**: Hardcore users who want complete control
- **Pros**: Super feature-rich, fine-grained settings
- **Cons**: Clunky interface, not beginner-friendly

### **5. Mastodon (official app)**
- **Best for**: Simple, official experience
- **Pros**: Clean UI, good notifications
- **Cons**: Lacks some federated features, only works with Mastodon (not other Fediverse servers)

**Recommendation**:  
Go with **Tusky** for a smooth and stable experience, or **Megalodon** if you want a little extra power. Try **Fedilab** if youâ€™re into deep customization.

Want something open source and privacy-focused only, or are you okay with Play Store apps?
