Pandoc filters are programs that can modify the abstract syntax tree (AST) generated by Pandoc before it is converted into the final output format. They are widely used to customize document processing. Here is a list of some popular and currently available Pandoc filters:

### 1. **pandoc-citeproc**
   - **Function**: Processes citations in the document. It is often used to generate bibliographies and to format citations according to various styles.

### 2. **pandoc-crossref**
   - **Function**: Adds support for cross-references (like figures, tables, sections, and equations) in Pandoc documents.

### 3. **pandoc-fignos**
   - **Function**: Handles figure numbering and referencing. It allows you to automatically number figures and refer to them in the text.

### 4. **pandoc-tablenos**
   - **Function**: Similar to `pandoc-fignos`, but for tables. It manages table numbering and referencing within a document.

### 5. **pandoc-eqnos**
   - **Function**: Adds numbering to equations and supports referencing them throughout the document.

### 6. **pandoc-include**
   - **Function**: Allows you to include content from external files into your document, facilitating modular document creation.

### 7. **pandoc-lua-filters**
   - **Function**: A collection of Lua-based filters for various purposes like handling LaTeX code, formatting tables, or converting specific markdown elements.

### 8. **pandoc-filters** (a Python library)
   - **Function**: Provides a framework for writing custom Pandoc filters in Python. It allows you to create filters that can be used to modify documents according to your needs.

### 9. **pandoc-citeproc-py**
   - **Function**: An alternative to `pandoc-citeproc`, written in Python, for processing citations and bibliographies.

### 10. **pandoc-sidenote**
   - **Function**: Converts inline notes into sidenotes, useful for academic writing and annotations.

### 11. **pandoc-quotes**
   - **Function**: Ensures that quotes are correctly formatted according to the output format, particularly useful when converting between different language quotation styles.

### 12. **pandoc-xnos**
   - **Function**: A suite of filters including `pandoc-fignos`, `pandoc-tablenos`, and `pandoc-eqnos`, for comprehensive cross-referencing support.

### 13. **pandoc-placetable**
   - **Function**: Reorders table captions and allows more flexible table placement in LaTeX/PDF output.

### 14. **pandoc-imagine**
   - **Function**: Generates images on the fly from inline code, useful for diagrams or mathematical plots.

### 15. **pandoc-plantuml**
   - **Function**: Processes PlantUML diagrams embedded in markdown, converting them into images in the final document.

### 16. **pandoc-mermaid**
   - **Function**: Converts Mermaid.js code blocks into diagrams within the final document.

### 17. **pandoc-scholarly-metadata**
   - **Function**: Handles scholarly metadata such as DOI, keywords, and abstract, providing structured data in the output.

### 18. **pandoc-include-code**
