Yes and no—it’s complicated, but here’s the breakdown:

---

### 👩 Who *is* Elizabeth Keen’s mother?
**Katarina Rostova** is firmly established *in-universe* as Liz’s biological mother—a former KGB spy whose complicated life is revealed across seasons through flashbacks and character revelations citeturn0search5turn0search25.

### 🧩 Is "Red" (Raymond Reddington) actually Liz’s mother?
A popular fan theory—often dubbed **“Redarina”**—suggests that **the man known as Raymond Reddington (played by James Spader)** is actually **Katarina Rostova** who underwent a transformation and took on Reddington's identity. This theory points to many narrative hints, including:

- Season 8’s **“Nachalo”/“Konets” finales**, which heavily imply that the person we’ve known as “Red” may be Katarina in disguise citeturn0search2turn0search11turn0search9.
- A line where Agnes (Liz’s daughter) calls Red “being such a mom,” and Red responds, “I just can’t help it”—a moment some interpret as maternal behavior citeturn0search4.
- Discussion from producers and Easter eggs suggesting this twist was part of the show’s long-game mythology citeturn0search11.

**So, has the show *confirmed* this?**

Not explicitly. The series leaves it tantalizingly ambiguous:
- The **original Raymond Reddington** (the real father) is confirmed deceased, and his identity is assumed by an “impostor.” citeturn0search11turn0search21  
- This impostor's true identity—whether he is Katarina, Ilya, or someone else—**remains unconfirmed on screen** citeturn0search7turn0search21.
- Showrunners and interviews hint that the *idea* was seeded from the start—but again, without a definitive on‑camera reveal citeturn0search11.

### 🧠 TL;DR

| Question | Answer |
|---------|--------|
| Is Katarina Rostova Liz’s mother? | ✅ Yes, this is clearly confirmed. |
| Is “Red” actually Katarina in disguise? | ⚠️ He *might be*, according to fan theory and show hints—*but it’s never been officially confirmed on-screen.* |

---

### In short:
- **Katarina Rostova** is certainly *Liz Keen’s mother*.
- Whether the man known as **Raymond “Red” Reddington** is *actually Katarina* is an **open mystery**, left deliberately ambiguous by the writers—though strongly hinted at by show clues and some cast/crew commentary.

If you're up for theories, this is definitely one of TV's most debated twists. Let me know if you'd like to dive deeper into the evidence!
