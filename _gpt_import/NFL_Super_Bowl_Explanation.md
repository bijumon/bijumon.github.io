Explain nfl finals
## assistant

The **NFL Finals** is not an official term, but if you're referring to the championship game of the **National Football League (NFL)**, that would be the **Super Bowl**. The Super Bowl is the culmination of the NFL playoffs, where the winners of the **AFC (American Football Conference) Championship** and **NFC (National Football Conference) Championship** face off for the league title.  

### **How the NFL Playoffs Work:**  
1. **Regular Season (18 Weeks, 17 Games per Team)** – Teams compete to qualify for the playoffs.  
2. **Playoffs (14 Teams Qualify: 7 from AFC, 7 from NFC)** – A knockout-style tournament leading to the Super Bowl.  
   - The **top seed in each conference** gets a first-round bye.  
   - Other teams play in **Wild Card, Divisional, and Conference Championship rounds**.  
3. **Super Bowl** – The AFC and NFC champions play to determine the NFL champion.
