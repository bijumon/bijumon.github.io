## assistant

Supply Chain Management (SCM) at the **diploma level** usually includes a **basic to moderate amount of mathematics**, mostly **applied math** rather than abstract theory. Here's a breakdown of how much and what kind of mathematics you can expect:

---

### ðŸ”¢ **Approximate Share of Mathematics**
- **15% to 30%** of the coursework may directly involve mathematical concepts.
- The rest involves logistics, operations, procurement, warehousing, software tools, and business concepts.

### ðŸ“˜ **Types of Mathematics Used in SCM (Diploma Level)**

| Area                     | Math Involved                                         | Example Topics                           |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Inventory Management** | Arithmetic, ratios, EOQ formula                       | Economic Order Quantity, Reorder Level    |
| **Forecasting**          | Averages, moving averages, regression basics         | Demand Forecasting                        |
| **Transportation & Routing** | Basic algebra, distance/time/speed, optimization    | Least-cost route, Vehicle Scheduling      |
| **Costing & Budgeting**  | Percentages, profit/loss, unit costing               | Freight costing, landed cost              |
| **Operations Research**  | Simple linear programming (graphical), matrices      | Resource allocation, bottleneck analysis  |
| **Statistics** (basic)   | Mean, median, standard deviation                     | Quality Control, Trend analysis           |
| **Spreadsheet Math**     | Formulas and calculations in Excel                   | Logistics modeling and KPI tracking       |
