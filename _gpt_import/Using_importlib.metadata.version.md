how does importlib.metadata.version work in python
## assistant

The `importlib.metadata.version` function in Python is used to retrieve the version number of an installed package. It is part of the `importlib.metadata` module, which provides tools for querying and accessing metadata from Python packages.

### Usage
Here's how you can use `importlib.metadata.version`:

```python
from importlib.metadata import version

package_version = version('package_name')
print(package_version)
```

### Parameters
- **package_name**: This is a string that represents the name of the package whose version you want to retrieve.

### Returns
- The function returns the version string of the specified package.

### Example
Let's say you want to get the version of the `requests` package:

```python
from importlib.metadata import version

requests_version = version('requests')
print(requests_version)
```

If `requests` is installed, this would output something like:

```
2.26.0
```

### Notes
- If the package is not installed, `importlib.metadata.version` will raise a `PackageNotFoundError`.
- `importlib.metadata` is available in Python 3.8 and later. If you are using an older version of Python, you can achieve similar functionality with the `pkg_resources` module from `setuptools`.
