To remove unused or unwanted DNF repositories, follow these steps:

### 1. List All Enabled Repositories
To see all enabled repositories, use:
```bash
dnf repolist
```

For a full list of repositories (enabled and disabled), use:
```bash
dnf repolist all
```

### 2. Identify and Disable Unwanted Repositories
If you just want to disable a repository without removing it, you can disable it by setting `enabled=0` in its repo file.

To disable a specific repository (replace `repoid` with the actual ID):
```bash
sudo dnf config-manager --set-disabled repoid
```

### 3. Delete Unused Repository Files
To permanently remove a repository, delete its `.repo` file from the `/etc/yum.repos.d/` directory. Find the exact `.repo` file name that you want to delete by listing the files in this directory:
```bash
ls /etc/yum.repos.d/
```

Then delete the desired file:
```bash
sudo rm /etc/yum.repos.d/<repo-file>.repo
```

### 4. Clean Up Cache
After making these changes, clear the cache to ensure DNF doesn't use any cached data from removed repositories:
```bash
sudo dnf clean all
```

This will remove the repositories from DNF and clean up your system for a more streamlined experience.

To remove unused or unnecessary DNF repositories on a system using Fedora, RHEL, or CentOS, follow these steps:

### 1. **List all enabled repositories**
First, list all the currently enabled repositories:
```bash
dnf repolist enabled
```
This will show you all the active repositories.

### 2. **Identify the unused repositories**
You can check if a repository is not being used by reviewing the list of enabled repositories or by comparing them with the ones in your `/etc/yum.repos.d/` directory.

To see all the available repositories (enabled or not):
```bash
dnf repolist all
```

### 3. **Disable a repository**
To disable a repository without removing it (in case you might want to re-enable it later), use the following command:
```bash
sudo dnf config-manager --set-disabled <repo_name>
```
Replace `<repo_name>` with the actual name of the repository you wish to disable.

### 4. **Remove a repository**
If you want to completely remove the repository configuration file, navigate to the `/etc/yum.repos.d/` directory:
```bash
cd /etc/yum.repos.d/
```

Here, you'll find `.repo` files for each repository. To remove an unused repository, simply delete its `.repo` file:
```bash
sudo rm <repo_file.repo>
```
Replace `<repo_file.repo>` with the name of the file associated with the repository you want to remove.

### 5. **Clean up repository metadata**
Once youâ€™ve removed or disabled unnecessary repositories, clean up your system:
```bash
sudo dnf clean all
```
This will remove any cached repository metadata and package files that are no longer needed.

### 6. **Verify the removal**
To ensure the repository is no longer available, run the `dnf repolist enabled` command again to confirm it's been disabled or removed. 

This process should help you maintain a cleaner and more efficient repository configuration.
