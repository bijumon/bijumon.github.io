Which letters of the english alphabet are replaceable by numbers 
## assistant

In various forms of informal writing, especially in internet slang, "leet speak" (1337 speak), and stylized text (like passwords, gamertags, or graffiti art), certain **English letters are commonly replaced with similar-looking numbers**. Here are the most typical substitutions:

| Letter | Number | Reason (visual similarity)              |
|--------|--------|------------------------------------------|
| A      | 4      | The number 4 resembles a capital A.      |
| B      | 8      | The number 8 looks like a stylized B.    |
| E      | 3      | The number 3 resembles a backward E.     |
| G      | 6      | 6 can resemble a lowercase g in shape.   |
| I      | 1      | 1 looks like a lowercase L or capital I. |
| L      | 1      | Same as I; 1 looks like L.               |
| O      | 0      | Zero looks like the letter O.            |
| S      | 5      | The number 5 resembles a backward S.     |
| T      | 7      | 7 is often used for T in leetspeak.      |
| Z      | 2      | 2 looks like a reversed Z.               |

So, **letters that are commonly replaced by numbers** include:

**A, B, E, G, I, L, O, S, T, Z**

These substitutions are not standardized but are widely recognized in specific subcultures or for stylistic purposes.
