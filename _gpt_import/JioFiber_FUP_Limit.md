JioFiber's "unlimited" broadband plans come with a Fair Usage Policy (FUP) that sets a monthly data cap, after which your internet speed is significantly reduced.

### 📊 JioFiber FUP Limits by Plan

| Plan Speed | Monthly FUP Limit | Post-FUP Speed |
|------------|-------------------|----------------|
| 30–500 Mbps | 3,300 GB (3.3 TB) | 1 Mbps citeturn0search12 |
| 1 Gbps (Rs 3,999 plan) | 3,300 GB | 1 Mbps |
| 1 Gbps (Rs 8,499 plan) | 6,600 GB (6.6 TB) | 1 Mbps citeturn0search8 |

Once you exceed the FUP limit, your speed drops to 1 Mbps for the remainder of the billing cycle. You can restore your original speed by either waiting for the next billing cycle or purchasing a data booster pack.
