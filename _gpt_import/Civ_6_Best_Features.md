Two of the best features in **Civilization VI** (Civ 7 hasn't been released yet) are:

1. **District System**: Cities are no longer confined to a single tile. Instead, you can build specialized districts on separate tiles, each dedicated to specific types of infrastructure (e.g., science, culture, military). This adds strategic depth by forcing players to make decisions based on terrain and resource availability.

2. **Eureka and Inspiration Moments**: These mechanics allow players to boost their technology and civic research by completing specific in-game objectives. This encourages a more dynamic and adaptive approach to gameplay, rewarding exploration and interaction with the world.

Two of the best features of *Civilization VI* (Civ 7 hasn't been released as of now) are:

1. **Dynamic City Expansion (Unstacked Cities)**: Cities in *Civ VI* are spread across multiple tiles rather than being confined to one. This unstacked cities feature allows players to place districts and wonders on different tiles, adding depth to city planning and strategic positioning. The choice of where to build specific districts, such as industrial zones or campuses, can have a big impact on your city’s development and specialization.

2. **Active Research and Civic Trees**: The tech tree and civic tree in *Civ VI* progress through active involvement in world events. For example, founding a city on the coast boosts naval technologies, while engaging in combat can accelerate military advancements. This "Eureka" and "Inspiration" system rewards players for aligning their gameplay with technological or cultural goals, making the development feel more interactive and personalized.
