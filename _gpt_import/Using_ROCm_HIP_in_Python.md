How can I use rocm hip from python
## assistant

To use ROCm HIP (Heterogeneous-Computing Interface for Portability) from Python, you need to set up the ROCm environment on your system, install the required libraries, and utilize HIP-compatible Python libraries like `pyHIPIFY` or `pyHIP` to access HIP functionality.

Here’s a guide to get started:

### 1. Install ROCm
Ensure that ROCm is installed on your system. You can follow the instructions from the [ROCm Installation Guide](https://rocmdocs.amd.com/en/latest/Installation_Guide/Installation-Guide.html) to install the required packages.

### 2. Set up Python Libraries
ROCm has Python libraries that allow you to use HIP within Python. You may need to install libraries like `pyHIPIFY` (for converting CUDA code to HIP), `rocpy` (if available for your ROCm version), or libraries that support GPU acceleration, such as `PyTorch` with ROCm.

1. **Install PyTorch with ROCm:**
   ```bash
   pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/rocm5.2
   ```
   Replace `rocm5.2` with your specific ROCm version.

2. **Install `pyHIPIFY` (Optional for CUDA Code):**
   `pyHIPIFY` is a tool that translates CUDA code to HIP, useful if you have CUDA-based Python code you want to run on HIP. Install with:
   ```bash
   pip install pyhipify
   ```

3. **ROCm-Specific Libraries:** If you're performing machine learning or data science tasks, libraries like `ROCm MIOpen` (for deep learning) and `rocBLAS` (for linear algebra) are often bundled with ROCm-supported PyTorch and other frameworks.

### 3. Using HIP in Python Code
Once installed, you can start using PyTorch for GPU-accelerated tasks on AMD hardware with the ROCm backend:

```python
import torch

# Check if ROCm-capable GPU is available
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    print("ROCm-capable GPU detected")
    device = torch.device("cuda")
else:
    print("No ROCm-capable GPU detected.")
    device = torch.device("cpu")

# Sample tensor operation on ROCm
a = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0]).to(device)
b = torch.tensor([4.0, 5.0, 6.0]).to(device)
result = a + b

print("Result on GPU:", result)
```

### 4. For Advanced HIP Access
For more advanced HIP features, consider using ROCm’s Python API if available for your ROCm version, or directly writing custom HIP kernels by integrating with C++ HIP code.

Here are three sample programs you can try with ROCm HIP in Python:

### 1. **Matrix Multiplication (GPU-Accelerated)**
   This program will showcase the GPU's capabilities by performing matrix multiplication on large matrices. It’s useful for understanding basic tensor operations and will run significantly faster on the GPU than on the CPU.

   ```python
   import torch
   import time

   device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")

   # Initialize large matrices
   A = torch.randn(1000, 1000, device=device)
   B = torch.randn(1000, 1000, device=device)

   # Time the matrix multiplication on GPU
   start = time.time()
   C = torch.matmul(A, B)
   print("Time taken on GPU:", time.time() - start, "seconds")

   # Check the result shape
   print("Result matrix shape:", C.shape)
   ```

   This program can serve as a baseline to test performance and helps you learn GPU-based linear algebra operations using HIP-enabled PyTorch.

### 2. **Image Processing with ROCm GPU**
   Perform image manipulation, like applying a filter to an image, using GPU acceleration. This is a good exercise for GPU-based data manipulation and working with tensors.

   ```python
   import torch
   import torchvision.transforms as T
   from PIL import Image

   # Load image and convert to tensor
   img = Image.open("sample_image.jpg").convert("RGB")
   transform = T.Compose([T.ToTensor(), T.Resize((512, 512))])
   img_tensor = transform(img).unsqueeze(0).to(device)

   # Define a simple kernel (edge detection)
   edge_filter = torch.tensor([[-1, -1, -1], [-1, 8, -1], [-1, -1, -1]], device=device)
   edge_filter = edge_filter.view(1, 1, 3, 3)  # Reshape for convolution

   # Apply convolution filter
   img_edges = torch.nn.functional.conv2d(img_tensor, edge_filter)

   # Convert back to image format
   result_img = T.ToPILImage()(img_edges.squeeze(0).cpu())
   result_img.save("output_edge_detection.jpg")
   ```

   This program applies an edge detection filter to an image, demonstrating how to use ROCm for GPU-accelerated image processing.

### 3. **Logistic Regression on GPU**
   Implement a simple logistic regression model to classify data. This will showcase how to perform machine learning tasks on the GPU and involves using PyTorch’s autograd capabilities.

   ```python
   import torch
   from torch.utils.data import TensorDataset, DataLoader

   device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")

   # Generate synthetic data
   X = torch.randn(1000, 2).to(device)
   y = (X[:, 0] * X[:, 1] > 0).float().to(device)  # Labels based on sign of product

   dataset = TensorDataset(X, y)
   loader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=64, shuffle=True)

   # Define logistic regression model
   model = torch.nn.Sequential(torch.nn.Linear(2, 1), torch.nn.Sigmoid()).to(device)
   criterion = torch.nn.BCELoss()
   optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

   # Training loop
   for epoch in range(50):
       for batch_X, batch_y in loader:
           optimizer.zero_grad()
           predictions = model(batch_X).squeeze()
           loss = criterion(predictions, batch_y)
           loss.backward()
           optimizer.step()
       print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}, Loss: {loss.item()}")

   # Test a sample prediction
   test_point = torch.tensor([[0.5, -0.5]], device=device)
   print("Predicted label:", model(test_point).item())
   ```

   This logistic regression program demonstrates GPU acceleration for model training and uses autograd for automatic differentiation, showcasing how to build basic machine learning algorithms on ROCm.
