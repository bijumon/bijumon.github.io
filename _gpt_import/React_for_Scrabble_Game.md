For creating a **web game like Scrabble** with **animations**, **React** is a solid choice — but depending on your exact goals (performance, style of animations, interactivity), other frameworks or libraries might also be worth considering.

Here’s a breakdown of the best options:

---

### ✅ **React (Recommended if you're familiar with it)**
- **Why it's good:**
  - Massive ecosystem and community.
  - Easy to manage UI state (e.g. board tiles, drag-and-drop).
  - Excellent with component reusability.
  - **Animation**: You can use libraries like:
    - [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) – very smooth and React-friendly.
    - [React Spring](https://react-spring.dev/) – physics-based animations.
  - Rich drag-and-drop options (like [`react-beautiful-dnd`](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd)).

- **When to choose React**:
  - You want clean architecture and maintainability.
  - You want to make a modern, animated UI (board, tiles, effects).
  - You're not doing heavy canvas/WebGL rendering.

### 🧩 **Alternatives (Depending on your game complexity)**

#### 🟣 **PixiJS** or **Phaser** (If you want game-engine-like behavior)
- Best for **2D games**, but more canvas/WebGL-focused.
- Better performance for **complex animations** and dynamic graphics.
- Not ideal for traditional DOM-based UI like menus or text fields.
- Phaser even includes a full game loop and physics.

#### 🟨 **Vue.js**
- Smaller and simpler than React.
- Easier for beginners, but fewer high-quality animation tools for game-like UI.
- Good for simple, DOM-based tile games.

#### 🟥 **Svelte**
- Excellent built-in animation and transition capabilities.
- Minimal boilerplate and highly reactive.
- Great for performance, but ecosystem is smaller than React’s.

### 🔁 Recommendation Summary

| Framework      | Best For                          | Animation Support         | Complexity |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------|------------|
| **React + Framer Motion** | DOM-based Scrabble-like games | 🟢 Excellent                | 🟠 Moderate |
| **PixiJS / Phaser**        | Canvas-based tile games       | 🟢 Excellent (canvas-based) | 🔴 High     |
| **Vue.js**                 | Simpler UI-based games        | 🟡 Good                    | 🟢 Easy     |
| **Svelte**                 | Reactive UI with transitions  | 🟢 Excellent               | 🟢 Easy     |

### 🧠 Final Advice

- If you're planning a **web app game** with **DOM elements, drag/drop, and animations**, use **React + Framer Motion**.
- If you're going for more **canvas-heavy rendering**, consider **PixiJS** or **Phaser**.
- If you want to keep things lightweight with less boilerplate, **Svelte** is very good, especially for solo or small-team devs.
