Python difference between tuple and list
## assistant

In Python, **tuples** and **lists** are both used to store collections of items, but they have several key differences:

| Feature | List (`[]`) | Tuple (`()`) |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| **Mutability** | ✅ Mutable (can change elements, add, remove) | ❌ Immutable (cannot change after creation) |
| **Syntax** | `my_list = [1, 2, 3]` | `my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)` |
| **Methods** | Has many methods like `append()`, `remove()`, `sort()` | Fewer methods, mostly just `count()` and `index()` |
| **Performance** | Slightly slower (more overhead due to mutability) | Slightly faster (optimized due to immutability) |
| **Use Cases** | Good for collections that need to change (e.g. user input, dynamic data) | Good for fixed data (e.g. coordinates, function return values) |
| **Hashable** | ❌ Not hashable (can't be dictionary keys) | ✅ Hashable if all elements are immutable |

### Examples:

```python
# List example
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list.append(4)  # Works

# Tuple example
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
# my_tuple.append(4)  # Error: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'append'
```

### Summary:
- Use **lists** when you need to change the data.
- Use **tuples** when you want to ensure the data remains constant or needs to be used as a key in a dictionary.

Explain the hashable part

Great question! Let's dive into what **"hashable"** means and why it matters for tuples and lists in Python.

### 🔑 What does *hashable* mean?

In Python, an object is **hashable** if:

1. It has a **hash value** that doesn’t change during its lifetime (this is returned by the built-in `hash()` function).
2. It can be used as a **key in a dictionary** or stored in a **set**.

> In simple terms: **Immutable = Hashable (usually)**

### 🔍 Lists vs Tuples and Hashability

#### ❌ Lists are **not hashable**:
- Lists are **mutable** (you can change their content).
- Because their content can change, their hash could change too — which would break dictionary/set behavior.
- So Python forbids using lists as keys in dictionaries or storing them in sets.

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
# hash(my_list)  # ❌ Raises TypeError
# {my_list: "value"}  # ❌ TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'
```

#### ✅ Tuples **can be hashable**, but with a condition:
- Tuples themselves are **immutable**.
- However, if a tuple **contains mutable elements (like a list inside it)**, then it’s **not hashable**.

```python
# Tuple of immutable elements => hashable
t1 = (1, 2, 3)
print(hash(t1))  # ✅ Works

# Tuple with a list inside => not hashable
t2 = (1, 2, [3, 4])
# hash(t2)  # ❌ TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'
```

### ✅ Summary:

| Type     | Hashable? | Can be a dict key? |
|----------|-----------|--------------------|
| `list`   | ❌ No      | ❌ No               |
| `tuple`  | ✅ Yes*    | ✅ Yes*             |

> *Only if all elements inside the tuple are also hashable.

Let me know if you want to see how this applies in real dictionary/set examples!
