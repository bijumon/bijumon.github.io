diff show changes in file 1
## assistant

If you're referring to using `git diff` to show changes in a specific file, hereâ€™s how you can do it:

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the repository containing the file.
2. Run the following command to view changes in `file1`:

   ```bash
   git diff file1
   ```

   This command will display the differences between the working directory and the index (staging area) for `file1`.

### Key Variations
- To compare the working directory with the last committed version of the file:
  ```bash
  git diff HEAD file1
  ```
- To compare staged changes with the last commit:
  ```bash
  git diff --cached file1
  ```
- To view changes between two specific commits for `file1`:
  ```bash
  git diff <commit1> <commit2> -- file1
  ```

diff show changes in FILE1

To show differences in a file named `FILE1` using `diff`, you can run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
diff FILE1 FILE2
```

This compares `FILE1` with another file, `FILE2`, and shows the changes between them.

If you're comparing `FILE1` against a version in a Git repository (like its last committed state), use:

```bash
git diff FILE1
```

This will show changes made to `FILE1` compared to the last commit.

## user
diff show changes in FILE1 only

## assistant

If you want to see changes in a specific file, such as `FILE1`, when using the `git diff` command, you can explicitly specify the file like this:

```bash
git diff FILE1
```

This will display only the changes made to `FILE1` in the working directory compared to the staging area. If you want to compare the file with another commit or branch, you can use:

### Compare with the last commit:
```bash
git diff HEAD FILE1
```

### Compare between two commits:
```bash
git diff COMMIT1 COMMIT2 -- FILE1
```

### Compare with the staging area:
```bash
git diff --staged FILE1
```

These commands limit the diff output to the specified file, making it easier to focus on changes in `FILE1`.
## user
diff show lines from FILE1 only

## assistant

To show lines from **FILE1** only (lines present in FILE1 but not in FILE2) using the `diff` command, you can use the `--old-line-format` option combined with `--unchanged-line-format` to display only the lines unique to FILE1. Here's how:

```bash
diff --old-line-format='%L' --new-line-format='' --unchanged-line-format='' FILE1 FILE2
```

### Explanation:
- `--old-line-format='%L'`: Print lines from FILE1 only.
- `--new-line-format=''`: Suppress lines from FILE2.
- `--unchanged-line-format=''`: Suppress lines that are the same in both files.

### Example:

**FILE1**:
```
apple
banana
cherry
date
```

**FILE2**:
```
banana
date
elderberry
```

Running the command:

```bash
diff --old-line-format='%L' --new-line-format='' --unchanged-line-format='' FILE1 FILE2
```

**Output**:
```
apple
cherry
```

This shows only the lines that are present in FILE1 but not in FILE2.
## assistant

To show lines that exist only in `FILE1` when comparing two files (`FILE1` and `FILE2`), you can use the `comm` command or `diff` command in Linux/Unix.

### Using `comm`:
1. Ensure both files are sorted:
   ```bash
   sort FILE1 -o FILE1
   sort FILE2 -o FILE2
   ```
2. Use `comm` to display lines unique to `FILE1`:
   ```bash
   comm -23 FILE1 FILE2
   ```

### Using `diff`:
If you want a more visual diff format:
```bash
diff --unchanged-line-format="" --old-line-format="%L" --new-line-format="" FILE1 FILE2
```

This command suppresses lines that are unchanged or exist only in `FILE2`, leaving only lines unique to `FILE1`.

### Explanation:
- `comm` is a simple command that works line by line and requires sorted input.
- The `diff` approach works without sorting but is more complex.
## user
diff show lines from FILE1 only usinf %<

## assistant

In `diff`, the `%<` symbol can be used to show lines that are unique to the first file when comparing two files. To use this effectively:

### Command Example:
```bash
diff FILE1 FILE2 --old-line-format='%<'
```

### Explanation:
- `--old-line-format='%<'`:
  - Shows lines that are in `FILE1` but not in `FILE2`.
  - Each line unique to `FILE1` will be printed as it is.
  
### Notes:
- This works with the **`diff`** utility on most Unix-like systems.
- If you also want to control how other line differences are displayed, you can combine it with `--new-line-format` and `--unchanged-line-format` options.
