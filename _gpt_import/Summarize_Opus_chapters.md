Sure! Here's a summary of the first four chapters of *Opus: Echo of Starsong*, with one paragraph for each:

---

**Chapter 1 – The Forgotten Name**  
The story begins with Jun Lee, an exiled noble from the powerful Lumen Sage clan, who is searching the stars for redemption. Now an old man, he reflects on his past journey, which begins when he meets Eda, a mysterious girl with the rare ability to hear starsongs—resonances that guide explorers to valuable Lumen caves. After Jun's failed attempt to reclaim his status by capturing a cave, he partners with Eda and her guardian Remi, setting off on a new mission aboard their ship, the Red Chamber.

**Chapter 2 – A Chance Encounter**  
Jun, Eda, and Remi begin investigating Lumen caves using Eda's starsong abilities. Along the way, they encounter rivals and remnants of the past war between the East Ocean and the United Mining Coalition. Their relationship deepens as trust begins to form, though personal motives and secrets remain. The crew also crosses paths with the Enforcers, hinting at political tensions and danger that will grow as they explore deeper into the Belt.

**Chapter 3 – A Bargain in Shadows**  
As they pursue a powerful Lumen cave linked to the mythical "Savior’s Song," the trio navigates the murky world of cave rights and smuggling. Jun’s ambitions clash with Eda’s ideals, leading to tension within the group. They make a risky deal with a pirate syndicate, exposing them to danger and testing their loyalty to one another. The chapter ends with a bitter betrayal, forcing the Red Chamber crew to reevaluate their mission.

**Chapter 4 – The Song of Separation**  
The fallout from the betrayal leads to a split in the crew. Jun’s past and pride create conflict, while Eda begins to question her role in the starsong search. Their bond is strained as each must confront the weight of their personal histories. With tensions rising and threats closing in, the group faces both physical and emotional trials, and the chapter ends on a somber note—marking a turning point in their journey.
