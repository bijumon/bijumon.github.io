match in shell files startting with capital B or C
## assistant

To find lines in shell files that start with a capital "B" or "C," you can use the `grep` command in your terminal. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
grep -Eh '^[BC]' *.sh
```

This command breaks down as follows:

- `grep`: Command to search through files.
- `-E`: Enables extended regular expressions.
- `-h`: Suppresses the filename in the output when searching through multiple files.
- `'^'`: Asserts the start of a line.
- `[BC]`: Matches either "B" or "C".
- `*.sh`: Searches through all files ending in `.sh` in the current directory.

This will display all lines in your shell files (`.sh`) that start with either a "B" or "C." If you want to include subdirectories in the search, you can add the `-r` flag to search recursively:

```bash
grep -Erh '^[BC]' *.sh
```

rsync from server1 files startting with capital B or C
## assistant

To use `rsync` to copy files from `server1` that start with a capital "B" or "C", you can run the following command:

```bash
rsync -avz --include='[BC]*' --exclude='*' user@server1:/path/to/source/ /path/to/destination/
```

Here's a breakdown of the command:

- `rsync`: The command to sync files and directories between two locations.
- `-avz`: These options are commonly used with `rsync`.
  - `-a`: Archive mode, which preserves symbolic links, permissions, timestamps, etc.
  - `-v`: Verbose mode, which provides more detailed output.
  - `-z`: Compresses data during the transfer to save bandwidth.
- `--include='[BC]*'`: Includes only files starting with "B" or "C".
- `--exclude='*'`: Excludes everything else.
- `user@server1:/path/to/source/`: The source path on `server1` (replace with the actual path and username).
- `/path/to/destination/`: The local destination path where the files should be copied (replace with the actual path).

This command will transfer only the files starting with "B" or "C" from `server1` to the specified destination.
## assistant

To use `rsync` to copy files from `server1` that start with a capital "B" or "C", you can use the following command:

```bash
rsync -avz server1:/path/to/source/[BC]* /path/to/destination/
```

### Explanation:
- **`rsync`**: The command to synchronize files and directories between two locations.
- **`-a`**: Archive mode, which preserves permissions, timestamps, symbolic links, etc.
- **`-v`**: Verbose mode, which provides detailed output.
- **`-z`**: Compresses data during transfer, which can be useful for reducing the size of the data being transferred over the network.
- **`server1:/path/to/source/[BC]*`**: The source path on `server1`, where `[BC]*` matches any file starting with "B" or "C".
- **`/path/to/destination/`**: The local destination path where the files will be copied.

Make sure to replace `/path/to/source/` and `/path/to/destination/` with the actual paths relevant to your situation.

firewall-cmd disable ssh in defaultzone except for local network
## assistant
To disable SSH access in the default zone of `firewalld` except for the local network, you can use the following commands:

### Step 1: Allow SSH only from the local network
```bash
firewall-cmd --zone=default --add-rich-rule='rule family="ipv4" source address="192.168.0.0/24" service name="ssh" accept'
```
- **`192.168.0.0/24`**: Replace this with your actual local network IP range. This example assumes a typical local network range.
- **`--add-rich-rule`**: Adds a rule to allow SSH from the specified network.

### Step 2: Remove SSH access for other networks
```bash
firewall-cmd --zone=default --remove-service=ssh
```
- This command removes SSH access from the default zone entirely, but since we've already added the exception for the local network in Step 1, only local network connections will be allowed.

### Step 3: Reload the firewall to apply changes
```bash
firewall-cmd --reload
```

### Step 4: Verify the configuration (optional)
```bash
firewall-cmd --zone=default --list-all
```
- This will list all services, ports, and rules active in the default zone. You should see the SSH service removed and the rich rule allowing SSH only from your local network.

These commands assume you're using IPv4. If you need to apply similar rules for IPv6, adjust the `family="ipv4"` to `family="ipv6"`.

firewall-cmd disable ssh in defaultzone except for local network 192.168.29.1

## assistant
To disable SSH access in the default zone for all networks except the local network `192.168.29.0/24` (assuming the subnet mask is `/24`), you can follow these steps using `firewall-cmd`.

### Step 1: Add the rule to allow SSH access only from the local network

```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=trusted --add-source=192.168.29.0/24
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=trusted --add-service=ssh
```

### Step 2: Block SSH access in the default zone

```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=default --remove-service=ssh
```

### Step 3: Reload the firewall to apply the changes

```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

### Explanation:
- **`--zone=trusted --add-source=192.168.29.0/24`**: Adds the local network `192.168.29.0/24` to the `trusted` zone.
- **`--zone=trusted --add-service=ssh`**: Allows SSH access in the `trusted` zone.
- **`--zone=default --remove-service=ssh`**: Removes SSH access from the default zone.
- **`--reload`**: Reloads the firewall configuration to apply the changes.

With these steps, SSH will be disabled in the default zone for all networks except the `192.168.29.0/24` local network.
## assistant
To disable SSH access in the default zone for all networks except the local network `192.168.29.1`, you can use the following steps with `firewall-cmd`:

1. **Add a rule to allow SSH from the local network:**

   ```bash
   sudo firewall-cmd --zone=default --add-source=192.168.29.1/24
   sudo firewall-cmd --zone=default --add-service=ssh
   ```

2. **Remove SSH from the default zone for all other networks:**

   ```bash
   sudo firewall-cmd --zone=default --remove-service=ssh
   ```

3. **Reload the firewall to apply the changes:**

   ```bash
   sudo firewall-cmd --reload
   ```

### Explanation:
- **`--zone=default`**: Specifies the default zone where the rules will be applied.
- **`--add-source=192.168.29.1/24`**: Adds the local network `192.168.29.1` with a subnet mask of `/24` (which allows all IPs in the range `192.168.29.1 - 192.168.29.254`).
- **`--add-service=ssh`**: Allows SSH service within the specified source.
- **`--remove-service=ssh`**: Removes SSH service from the default zone, effectively disabling SSH access from all other networks.
- **`--reload`**: Reloads the firewall rules to make the changes take effect.

This configuration will allow SSH access only from the local network `192.168.29.1/24` while blocking it for all other networks.

firewall-cmd disable ssh in defaultzone except for local network 192.168.29

## assistant
To configure `firewalld` to disable SSH access in the `default` zone except for the local network `192.168.29.0/24`, you can follow these steps:

1. **Open the firewall configuration**:
   ```bash
   sudo firewall-cmd --zone=default --remove-service=ssh --permanent
   ```

2. **Allow SSH access from the local network `192.168.29.0/24`**:
   ```bash
   sudo firewall-cmd --zone=default --add-rich-rule='rule family="ipv4" source address="192.168.29.0/24" service name="ssh" accept' --permanent
   ```

3. **Reload the firewall to apply changes**:
   ```bash
   sudo firewall-cmd --reload
   ```

### Explanation:

- **`--zone=default`**: Specifies that you are modifying rules for the default zone.
- **`--remove-service=ssh`**: Removes the SSH service from the default zone, effectively blocking SSH access.
- **`--add-rich-rule='rule family="ipv4" source address="192.168.29.0/24" service name="ssh" accept'`**: Adds a rich rule to allow SSH access only from the specified network.
- **`--permanent`**: Makes the changes persistent across reboots.
- **`--reload`**: Applies the changes immediately.

This setup will block SSH access from all IP addresses except those within the `192.168.29.0/24` subnet.
