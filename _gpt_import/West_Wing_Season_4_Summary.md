## assistant

Season 4 of *The West Wing* (2002–2003) begins with President Josiah "Jed" Bartlet in the middle of his re-election campaign. While dealing with personal and political challenges, Bartlet faces a tight race against his conservative opponent, Governor Robert Ritchie. The campaign includes memorable debates and culminates with Bartlet's successful re-election.

Throughout the season, various pressing domestic and international crises test the administration. There’s a focus on Bartlet's struggle to balance his personal beliefs with political realities, especially when dealing with Middle Eastern terrorism, labor strikes, and diplomatic tensions.

One of the key subplots is Bartlet's daughter Zoey's abduction by terrorists, which escalates into a severe national security crisis and forces Bartlet to temporarily step down, appointing Republican Speaker of the House Glen Walken as Acting President. This cliffhanger ending sets up the political and personal drama that continues into the next season.

Season 5
## assistant
In Season 5 of *The West Wing*, the story picks up immediately after the cliffhanger ending of Season 4, where President Bartlet’s daughter, Zoey, has been kidnapped. To avoid any conflict of interest and to maintain objectivity, Bartlet temporarily steps down, making Speaker of the House Glen Walken, a Republican, the Acting President. This transition heightens tensions in the White House and places Bartlet's staff in a difficult position, struggling with the emotional and political fallout.

After Zoey is rescued, Bartlet resumes his role as President, but the trauma of the incident affects him deeply, leading him to question some of his decisions and priorities. As the season progresses, Bartlet and his administration face numerous policy challenges, including dealing with budget negotiations, a tense Middle East peace process, a Supreme Court nomination, and the political ramifications of a government shutdown.

Relationships within the West Wing become strained, with some staff members questioning their own roles and future in the administration. One notable subplot is the tension between Chief of Staff Leo McGarry and Vice President John Hoynes, which escalates as Hoynes considers his own political ambitions. Additionally, Josh Lyman's frustration with the limitations of Bartlet's second term grows, and Donna Moss faces a life-threatening situation on a diplomatic trip to Gaza, culminating in another cliffhanger that impacts the entire team.

Overall, Season 5 focuses on the political and personal challenges of governing in a second term, as Bartlet and his team grapple with a shifting political landscape, ideological compromises, and the pressures of legacy.

Season 6
## assistant
Season 6 of *The West Wing* centers on both personal transformations and intense political maneuvering as the Bartlet administration begins to wind down, with President Bartlet’s second term nearing its end. The season has a dual focus: Bartlet’s ongoing international challenges and the fierce race to determine his successor.

The season starts with a focus on the peace process in the Middle East. President Bartlet takes a bold step by bringing Israeli and Palestinian leaders together in a challenging peace summit at Camp David. Bartlet’s health, however, becomes a significant issue as his multiple sclerosis worsens, creating moments of vulnerability and forcing him to increasingly rely on his staff.

The season then shifts to the campaigns for the next presidential election. Staff members begin leaving the White House to work on various campaigns. Josh Lyman, feeling disillusioned with the administration’s compromises, is especially drawn to Congressman Matt Santos, a principled Democrat from Texas. Josh sees in Santos a candidate who could energize the party and bring real change, so he convinces him to run for president. The dynamic between Josh and Santos, as well as Josh’s struggle to shape Santos into a viable candidate, becomes one of the season’s central storylines.

Meanwhile, Vice President Bob Russell, another leading Democratic contender, runs a more traditional campaign, and there are other prominent Democratic and Republican candidates in the race. The campaign trail brings high tensions and divides former West Wing colleagues as they join different candidates. The season explores themes of loyalty, idealism versus pragmatism, and the harsh realities of political campaigns.

Season 6 ends with the Democratic National Convention approaching, where Santos's underdog campaign gains unexpected momentum. This season sets the stage for the next generation of leadership while grappling with the challenges and sacrifices that come with the pursuit of power.
