i want to transfer a large folder 'X' with thousands of file from user0@192.168.26.158 to current directory. how can i do this using rsync and parallel command
## assistant

You can use `rsync` with the `parallel` command to transfer a large folder efficiently. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Ensure `rsync` and `parallel` are installed**:
   - On your local machine, run:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install rsync parallel
     ```

2. **Create the necessary command**:
   - Use the `rsync` command with `parallel` to split the task into multiple jobs that run concurrently. Below is a command template:

     ```bash
     ssh user0@192.168.26.158 "cd /path/to/folder/X && find . -type f" | \
     parallel -j 4 rsync -az --progress user0@192.168.26.158:/path/to/folder/X/{} ./
     ```

   Here’s what each part does:
   - `ssh user0@192.168.26.158 "cd /path/to/folder/X && find . -type f"`: Connects to the remote server, navigates to the directory containing folder `X`, and lists all files within it.
   - `parallel -j 4`: Executes up to 4 parallel `rsync` jobs at once. Adjust `-j 4` based on your network speed and CPU power.
   - `rsync -az --progress user0@192.168.26.158:/path/to/folder/X/{}`: Transfers each file listed by `find` to the current directory on your local machine. The `--progress` flag shows progress, and `-a` preserves the structure and attributes while `-z` compresses data during transfer.

3. **Execute the command**:
   - Run the command in your terminal. This will start transferring the files from the remote directory to your current directory.

**Notes**:
- Adjust `-j 4` depending on your system and network performance.
- Ensure the paths (`/path/to/folder/X`) are correct.
- If you encounter issues with file names containing spaces or special characters, you may need to modify the command to handle them (e.g., using `find . -type f -print0` with `parallel -0`).

This setup will help you transfer a large number of files more efficiently by parallelizing the process.

linux folder contains subfolders with spaces in their name. compress each folder using 7z, each compressed archive part is 1024MB in size and the compressed file does not contain spaces
## assistant
To compress each subfolder in a Linux directory using `7z`, with each archive split into parts of 1024MB and without spaces in the archive names, follow these steps:

1. **Ensure `7z` is installed**:
   - Install `p7zip` (which provides `7z` on Linux) if it’s not already installed:

## user
linux folder contains subfolders with spaces in their name. compress each folder using 7z, each compressed archive part is 1024MB in size, with compression level of store and the compressed file does not contain spaces
## assistant
To compress each subfolder in a directory using `7z`, with the following requirements:

- Each archive part is 1024MB.
- The compression level is set to "store" (no compression).
- The resulting archive files do not contain spaces in their names.

Here’s a step-by-step guide:

1. **Navigate to the directory containing the subfolders**:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/directory
   ```

2. **Run the `7z` command** to compress each subfolder individually:
   ```bash
   for folder in */; do 
       sanitized_name=$(echo "${folder%/}" | tr ' ' '_')
       7z a -v1024m -mx=0 "${sanitized_name}.7z" "$folder"
   done
   ```

   **Explanation**:
   - `for folder in */; do`: Loops through each subfolder in the current directory.
   - `sanitized_name=$(echo "${folder%/}" | tr ' ' '_')`: Replaces spaces in the folder name with underscores.
   - `7z a -v1024m -mx=0 "${sanitized_name}.7z" "$folder"`:
     - `a`: Add files to the archive.
     - `-v1024m`: Split the archive into 1024MB parts.
     - `-mx=0`: Set the compression level to "store" (no compression).
     - `"${sanitized_name}.7z"`: The name of the archive, with spaces replaced by underscores.
     - `"$folder"`: The folder to be compressed.

3. **Execution**:
   - Run the script in your terminal. Each subfolder will be compressed into a `.7z` archive with the specified settings.

This script ensures that spaces in folder names are replaced with underscores in the archive names, the compression level is set to "store," and the archives are split into 1024MB parts.

linux folder contains subfolders with spaces in their name. compress each folder using 7z, each compressed archive part is 1024MB in size, with compression level of store and the compressed file does not contain spaces and is stores in ~/Downloads
## assistant
To compress each subfolder individually using `7z` while handling spaces in folder names and ensuring the compressed files are stored in `~/Downloads` with a maximum size of 1024MB per archive part, follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step Command

1. **Navigate to the parent directory** where your subfolders are located:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/parent_directory
   ```

2. **Run the following `for` loop to compress each subfolder:**
   ```bash
   for dir in */; do
       # Remove trailing slash and replace spaces with underscores in folder name
       clean_dir_name=$(echo "${dir%/}" | tr ' ' '_')
       
       # Compress the folder using 7z with a split size of 1024MB and store in ~/Downloads
       7z a -t7z -m0=Copy -v1024m "~/Downloads/${clean_dir_name}.7z" "$dir"
   done
   ```

### Explanation:

- `for dir in */; do`: Loops through each subfolder in the current directory.
- `clean_dir_name=$(echo "${dir%/}" | tr ' ' '_')`: Removes the trailing slash from the folder name and replaces spaces with underscores.
- `7z a -t7z -m0=Copy -v1024m "~/Downloads/${clean_dir_name}.7z" "$dir"`:
  - `a`: Add files to archive.
  - `-t7z`: Specifies the 7z archive format.
  - `-m0=Copy`: Sets the compression level to "store" (no compression).
  - `-v1024m`: Splits the archive into parts of 1024MB each.
  - `~/Downloads/${clean_dir_name}.7z`: Specifies the output file name and location.
  - `"$dir"`: Refers to the current subfolder being processed.

This command will create a `.7z` archive for each subfolder in `~/Downloads`, with names having underscores instead of spaces, split into 1024MB parts, and with no compression applied to the contents.

rsync wildcard from remote ssh server
## assistant
To use `rsync` with wildcards to transfer files from a remote SSH server, you can use the following syntax. This method allows you to specify patterns to match multiple files or directories on the remote server.

### Basic Command Structure

```bash
rsync -avz user@remote_server:/path/to/files/*.txt /local/destination/
```

### Example

Let's say you want to transfer all `.txt` files from a specific directory on a remote server to your local machine:

```bash
rsync -avz user0@192.168.26.158:/path/to/remote/folder/*.txt /local/destination/
```

### Explanation:

- `rsync`: The command used for synchronizing files.
- `-a`: Archive mode, which preserves permissions, symbolic links, and timestamps.
- `-v`: Verbose mode, which shows detailed output during transfer.
- `-z`: Compresses data during transfer to save bandwidth.
- `user0@192.168.26.158:/path/to/remote/folder/*.txt`: Specifies the remote server, path, and files to be transferred. The `*.txt` wildcard matches all `.txt` files in the specified directory.
- `/local/destination/`: The local directory where the files will be saved.

### Notes:
- The wildcard (`*`) is evaluated on the remote server, so make sure the remote shell understands the pattern.
- If you want to transfer multiple types of files (e.g., `*.txt`, `*.jpg`), you might have to run the `rsync` command separately for each pattern or use a more complex pattern matching approach.

### Handling Complex Wildcards
For more complex cases where you need to match multiple patterns, or if you're unsure if the wildcard will be interpreted correctly on the remote server, you can use `rsync` in combination with `ssh` to execute a remote `find` command:

```bash
ssh user0@192.168.26.158 "find /path/to/remote/folder/ -name '*.txt'" | \
rsync -avz --files-from=- user0@192.168.26.158:/ /local/destination/
```

- The `find` command is used on the remote server to list all `.txt` files.
- `--files-from=-` tells `rsync` to read the list of files from its standard input (in this case, the output of the `find` command).

This approach can handle more complex file matching and directory structures.
