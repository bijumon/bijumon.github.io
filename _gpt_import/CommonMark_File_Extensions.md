CommonMark is a standardized and highly compatible specification of Markdown. Files that use the CommonMark format typically have one of the following file extensions:

- `.md` (most common)
- `.markdown`
- `.mkd`
- `.mkdn`
- `.mdown`
- `.text`
- `.txt`

The most widely used extension is `.md`.
## assistant

CommonMark, a widely used Markdown specification, typically uses the `.md` or `.markdown` file extensions. These extensions are standard for Markdown files, including those written in the CommonMark dialect.

So, the common file extensions for CommonMark files are:

- `.md`
- `.markdown`
## assistant

CommonMark files typically use the following file extensions:

1. **.md** - The most common extension for Markdown files, including CommonMark.
2. **.markdown** - Less common but still used, especially when wanting to explicitly indicate the file is in Markdown format.
3. **.mdown** - Another alternative extension, though it's less frequently used.

These extensions are often interchangeable and recognized by most Markdown editors and tools.

is cmark an extension

No, **`cmark`** is not a file extension. 

**`cmark`** is the name of the C implementation of CommonMark, a widely used Markdown specification. It is a library and a command-line program used to parse and render Markdown text according to the CommonMark specification. 

Files that are processed by `cmark` typically use standard Markdown file extensions like `.md` or `.markdown`.
## assistant
No, **cmark** is not a file extension. Instead, it refers to a specific CommonMark parser and renderer written in C. **cmark** is the reference implementation for the CommonMark specification, which means it's a tool that can parse and render CommonMark Markdown files into various formats like HTML.

So, **cmark** is a tool, not a file extension. The file extensions associated with CommonMark (and Markdown in general) are typically `.md`, `.markdown`, or `.mdown`.
