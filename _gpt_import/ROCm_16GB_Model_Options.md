What's a good model to run on rocm with 16gb vram

## assistant

With 16GB of VRAM on an AMD GPU using ROCm, your options depend on whether you want a language model (LLM) or a deep learning model for other tasks. Here are some good choices:

### **For LLMs (Text Generation & AI Chatbots)**
1. **Mistral-7B** – A high-quality, efficient 7B parameter model that can run well on 16GB VRAM.
2. **Llama 3 8B** (when available) – Expected to be a solid choice if optimized for ROCm.
3. **Phi-2** – A small but surprisingly capable model (2.7B) that runs very efficiently.
4. **StableLM-Tuned-3B** – Lightweight and decent for casual AI assistant tasks.

#### **Inference Tips**
- Use `llama.cpp` with ROCm support for optimized performance.
- Try `vLLM` or `text-generation-inference` for efficient inference.
- Use 4-bit quantization (like GGUF/ GPTQ) for larger models.

### **For Diffusion Models (Image Generation)**
1. **Stable Diffusion 1.5** – Runs fine on 16GB VRAM at full 512×512 resolution.
2. **Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL)** – Works with optimizations, but may need lower resolutions or a swap file.
3. **Kandinsky 2.2** – A good ROCm-friendly alternative for AI art.

### **For Other Deep Learning Tasks**
- **Whisper (for speech-to-text)** – Medium or Large models can run with optimizations.
- **ControlNet & ComfyUI for SD** – Works well with ROCm-supported PyTorch.

Would you like setup recommendations for any of these?

## **1. Install ROCm & PyTorch with ROCm Support**  
### **Ubuntu 22.04+ (Recommended)**
1. **Install ROCm**  
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   sudo apt install -y rocm-hip-runtime rocm-hip-sdk
   ```
2. **Add user to ROCm groups**  
   ```bash
   sudo usermod -aG video $USER
   sudo usermod -aG render $USER
   ```
   Then **reboot**.

3. **Verify ROCm is working**  
   ```bash
   rocminfo
   hipcc --version
   ```
   If ROCm is working correctly, these commands should return GPU information.

## **2. Running Large Language Models (LLMs)**
For models like **Mistral-7B**,
## user
Yes please , for fedora 41
## assistant
To set up ROCm (Radeon Open Compute) on Fedora 41 for running models like Mistral-7B, follow these steps:

### 1. **Install ROCm and AMD GPU Drivers**

ROCm is AMD's open-source software platform for GPU computing. While Fedora isn't officially supported by AMD for ROCm, the Fedora community has developed methods to install and run ROCm on Fedora systems. Here's how you can proceed:

1. **Enable the Necessary Repositories:**

   First, enable the Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (EPEL) repository and the CodeReady Builder repository:

   ```bash
   sudo dnf install epel-release
   sudo dnf config-manager --set-enabled crb
   ```


2. **Install Kernel Headers and Development Tools:**

   Ensure your system has the necessary kernel headers and development tools:

   ```bash
   sudo dnf install "kernel-headers-$(uname -r)" "kernel-devel-$(uname -r)" gcc-c++ make cmake
   ```


3. **Install ROCm Packages:**

   Install ROCm and related packages. Note that the package names might differ, so adjust accordingly:

   ```bash
   sudo dnf install rocm-hip-devel hipblas hipsparse hipsolver
   ```


   *Note: Some users have reported that installing the `rocm-hip-devel` package enables GPU support in applications like Blender.* citeturn0search5

4. **Verify Installation:**

   After installation, verify that ROCm recognizes your GPU:

   ```bash
   /opt/rocm/bin/rocminfo
   ```


   If your GPU details are displayed, the installation was successful.

### 2. **Set Up the Model Environment**

With ROCm installed, you can now set up the environment to run models like Mistral-7B.

1. **Install Python and Virtual Environment:**

   Ensure Python is installed and set up a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   sudo dnf install python3 python3-virtualenv
   python3 -m venv mistral_env
   source mistral_env/bin/activate
   ```


2. **Install PyTorch with ROCm Support:**

   Install PyTorch built for ROCm:

   ```bash
   pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/rocm5.4.2
   ```


   *Ensure the ROCm version in the URL matches your installed version.*

3. **Install Transformers Library:**

   Install the Hugging Face Transformers library to work with models like Mistral-7B:

   ```bash
   pip install transformers
   ```


4. **Download and Run Mistral-7B:**

   Use the Transformers library to download and run Mistral-7B:

   ```python
   from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

   tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("mistralai/Mistral-7B")
   model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("mistralai/Mistral-7B", torch_dtype=torch.float16).to("cuda")

   inputs = tokenizer("Hello, I'm a language model!", return_tensors="pt").to("cuda")
   outputs = model.generate(inputs.input_ids, max_length=50)
   print(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
   ```


   *Ensure your GPU is correctly utilized by verifying that the model and tensors are moved to "cuda".*
