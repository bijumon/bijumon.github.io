In *Civilization VI*, unit maintenance costs are fixed and do **not** change based on a unit's location. Whether a unit is inside a city, outside of it, in friendly territory, or in enemy territory, its maintenance cost remains the same. These costs are determined by the unit type and are listed in the Civilopedia or when selecting units for production【8:2†2KGMKT_CIV6_25TH_EXT_MANUAL.pdf】.

Therefore, keeping a unit inside a city does **not** reduce its maintenance cost—it only affects factors like healing rate.
