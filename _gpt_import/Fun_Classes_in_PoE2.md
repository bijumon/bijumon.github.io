In *Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire*, the "most fun" class can vary widely depending on playstyle, but here are some top contenders that many players find particularly enjoyable:

### 1. **Cipher**
   - **Why it’s fun**: Ciphers gain Focus from dealing damage, which they use to cast powerful spells without needing to rest or recharge. Their abilities are versatile, mixing damage, control, and debuffs, which makes them feel like a unique, high-impact spellcaster. The class feels dynamic because you’re always managing Focus and positioning to maximize impact.
   - **Playstyle**: They’re great for both ranged and melee, depending on subclass and abilities chosen.

### 2. **Chanter**
   - **Why it’s fun**: Chanters have a great variety of party-supporting abilities. They can sing passive chants that give buffs and gradually build phrases to cast invocations (big spells or summons). Their chants and invocations add a strategic layer, making combat feel tactical and satisfying.
   - **Playstyle**: Perfect for players who enjoy multitasking and supporting their team with buffs, debuffs, and summon spells.

### 3. **Rogue**
   - **Why it’s fun**: Rogues deal high single-target damage and are masters of sneak attacks and crits. They’re fast and agile, and with subclasses like Streetfighter, they gain bonuses in dangerous situations, encouraging riskier, high-reward play.
   - **Playstyle**: For those who enjoy stealth mechanics and massive damage spikes, Rogues are both thrilling and challenging, with options for melee or ranged setups.

### 4. **Druid**
   - **Why it’s fun**: Druids have strong spellcasting abilities with a mix of damage, healing, and utility. They also have a unique shapeshifting ability, letting them jump into the fray in beast form or stay back to sling spells, depending on the subclass.
   - **Playstyle**: A versatile caster with access to both natural magic and powerful transformations, making it enjoyable for those who like both spellcasting and melee options.

### 5. **Monk**
   - **Why it’s fun**: Monks gain Wounds by taking damage, which they use to fuel powerful martial arts abilities. This makes them feel like a kinetic powerhouse in melee combat, dishing out strong attacks and crowd control with a lot of flair.
   - **Playstyle**: Perfect for those who enjoy high-risk, high-reward play. Monks can be either tanky or DPS-oriented, and with subclasses, they offer unique mechanics like healing or added survivability.

### Honorable Mention: **Multi-Class Characters**
   - *Pillars II* has a unique multi-class system, and combining two classes opens up tons of interesting possibilities. For example, a Cipher/Rogue (Mindstalker) can be both a high-damage dealer and an effective controller, making it a very engaging mix.

Each class has its own strengths, but a lot of players find Ciphers, Rogues, and Monks to be among the most exciting, thanks to their high-impact abilities and active playstyles.
