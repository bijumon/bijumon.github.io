Embedding an image in multiple Opus audio files involves modifying the metadata of each file to include the image as a cover art. You can achieve this using various tools, including command-line utilities like FFmpeg, or graphical applications like Kid3 or MP3Tag. Here's a general approach using both FFmpeg and Kid3:

### Method 1: Using FFmpeg (Command Line)

1. **Install FFmpeg**: Make sure you have FFmpeg installed on your system. You can download it from [FFmpeg's official site](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).

2. **Prepare Your Image**: Ensure the image you want to embed is in a compatible format (e.g., PNG or JPEG).

3. **Command to Embed Image**: Use the following command to embed an image into an Opus file:

   ```bash
   ffmpeg -i input.opus -i cover.jpg -map 0 -map 1 -c copy -metadata:s:v title="Album cover" -metadata:s:v comment="Cover (front)" output.opus
   ```

   - Replace `input.opus` with the name of your Opus file.
   - Replace `cover.jpg` with the path to your image.
   - Replace `output.opus` with the desired name for the new file.

4. **Batch Processing**: To embed the same image in multiple Opus files, you can create a simple script (e.g., a Bash script for Linux) like this:

   ```bash
   for file in *.opus; do
       ffmpeg -i "$file" -i cover.jpg -map 0 -map 1 -c copy -metadata:s:v title="Album cover" -metadata:s:v comment="Cover (front)" "new_$file"
   done
   ```

   This will create new Opus files with the prefix `new_`.

### Method 2: Using Kid3 (Graphical Tool)

1. **Install Kid3**: Download and install Kid3 from [Kid3's website](https://kid3.kde.org/).

2. **Open Kid3**: Launch the application.

3. **Load Opus Files**: Open your Opus files by dragging them into the Kid3 window or using the "Open" option.

4. **Select Files**: Select all the Opus files to which you want to add the image.

5. **Add Cover Art**:
   - Go to the "Edit" menu and select "Add Cover" or use the cover art section in the properties pane.
   - Choose your image file.

6. **Save Changes**: After adding the image, make sure to save the changes for all selected files.

### Notes
- Always keep a backup of your original audio files before modifying them.
- If you're using FFmpeg, ensure that the output format supports the desired metadata features.
