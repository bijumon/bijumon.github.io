Howto write skeleton classes in python for a static site generator using composition and solid principles
## assistant
Writing skeleton classes for a static site generator in Python using composition and SOLID principles involves designing classes that are highly cohesive, loosely coupled, and follow the SOLID principles of object-oriented design. Here's a basic example to get you started:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each class should have only one reason to change.

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types.

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use.

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: Depend upon abstractions, not concrete implementations.

Let's create some skeleton classes for a static site generator:

```python
class SiteGenerator:
    def generate_site(self):
        pass

class ContentProvider:
    def get_content(self):
        pass

class FileManager(ContentProvider):
    def get_content(self):
        # Implementation to read content from files
        pass

class MarkdownParser(ContentProvider):
    def get_content(self):
        # Implementation to parse Markdown content
        pass

class HTMLGenerator:
    def generate_html(self, content):
        pass

class Page:
    def __init__(self, title, content):
        self.title = title
        self.content = content

class Site:
    def __init__(self):
        self.pages = []

    def add_page(self, page):
        self.pages.append(page)

    def generate(self):
        generator = HTMLGenerator()
        for page in self.pages:
            html_content = generator.generate_html(page.content)
            # Logic to write HTML content to files
```

Explanation:

- `SiteGenerator`: Responsible for coordinating the generation of the entire site.
- `ContentProvider`: An abstract class defining the interface for providing content. Concrete implementations like `FileManager` (for reading content from files) and `MarkdownParser` (for parsing Markdown content) adhere to this interface.
- `HTMLGenerator`: Responsible for generating HTML from content.
- `Page`: Represents a single page in the site, storing its title and content.
- `Site`: Represents the entire site, manages a collection of pages, and handles the generation of HTML for each page.

This structure allows for flexibility and extensibility. For instance, you can easily add new types of content providers or HTML generators without modifying existing code, adhering to the OCP. Additionally, by depending on abstractions (like the `ContentProvider` interface), rather than concrete implementations, the code adheres to the DIP.
