You can represent this grading logic in Python using a function that takes a numeric score and returns the corresponding letter grade:

```python
def get_grade(score):
    if score <= 40:
        return "F"
    elif 41 <= score <= 52:
        return "D"
    elif 53 <= score <= 64:
        return "C"
    elif 65 <= score <= 76:
        return "B"
    elif 77 <= score <= 88:
        return "A"
    else:
        return "Invalid score"

# Example usage
test_scores = [35, 50, 60, 70, 85, 95]
for score in test_scores:
    print(f"Score: {score} => Grade: {get_grade(score)}")
```

### Output:
```
Score: 35 => Grade: F  
Score: 50 => Grade: D  
Score: 60 => Grade: C  
Score: 70 => Grade: B  
Score: 85 => Grade: A  
Score: 95 => Grade: Invalid score
```

Let me know if you want to include higher ranges (like A+ for 89–100, etc.).

Here's a cleaner and more Pythonic rewrite of your `letter_grades` function with improved readability and concise comments:

```python
def letter_grades(highest):
    """Generate grade thresholds for D to A based on the highest exam score.

    :param highest: int - the highest possible exam score.
    :return: list - lower bounds for D, C, B, and A grades.
             For example, if highest is 100, returns [41, 56, 71, 86],
             corresponding to:
             D: 41–55, C: 56–70, B: 71–85, A: 86–100
    """
    failing_score = 40
    num_grades = 4  # D, C, B, A
    step = round((highest - failing_score) / num_grades)

    return [failing_score + 1 + step * i for i in range(num_grades)]
```

### Key improvements:
- Used list comprehension for compactness.
- Replaced magic number `41` with `failing_score + 1` for clarity.
- Removed unused `score` variable in the loop.

Let me know if you’d like it adapted for custom grade labels or ranges.
