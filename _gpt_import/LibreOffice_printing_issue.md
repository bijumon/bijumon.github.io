libreoffice printing only updates to same document
## assistant

Could you clarify a bit more about the issue you're facing in LibreOffice? Are you experiencing any of the following?

1. **Prints the same document repeatedly:**  
   - Even after selecting a different document, the printer keeps printing the previously printed document.

2. **Changes to the document don’t print:**  
   - The printout always shows the same version, despite updates in the document.

3. **Printer queue issue:**  
   - The printer queue is stuck with a specific document and won't accept new print jobs.

Let me know which scenario matches your issue, and I’ll guide you through the troubleshooting process.

To print **only updates** to an already printed document in LibreOffice, follow these methods based on your situation:

---

### **Method 1: Track Changes and Print Changes Only**
1. **Enable Track Changes:**
   - Go to **Edit > Track Changes > Record**.
   - Make your edits to the document.
   
2. **View Changes:**
   - Go to **Edit > Track Changes > Show** to see the changes.

3. **Print Only Changes:**
   - In **Print Options**, select **Document and Comments** or **Notes Only** (depending on your preference).

---

### **Method 2: Highlight Changes Manually**
1. Highlight the updated sections in the document using **background color** or **font color**.
2. Use **Find & Replace** to search for the highlighted text.
3. Print the highlighted pages:
   - Go to **File > Print > Range and Copies**.
   - Choose **Pages** and enter the relevant page numbers.

---

### **Method 3: Compare Documents**
1. **Create a copy** of the original document.
2. In LibreOffice, go to **Edit > Track Changes > Compare Document**.
3. Select the updated document.
4. LibreOffice will show the differences, which you can then print.

---

### **Method 4: Use Versioning**
1. Go to **File > Versions** and save a version of the original document.
2. After editing, save the new version.
3. Print the differences between versions.
