Topgrade is a versatile system maintenance utility that automates the process of updating various software components on your system. While Nobara, a Fedora-based Linux distribution, does not include Topgrade by default, you can manually install it to enhance your system maintenance routine. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Install Rust**: Topgrade is built using the Rust programming language, so you'll need to install Rust's package manager, `cargo`, to build Topgrade. Open a terminal and run:

   ```bash
   sudo dnf install cargo
   ```


2. **Install Topgrade**: Once `cargo` is installed, you can use it to install Topgrade by executing:

   ```bash
   cargo install topgrade
   ```


3. **Run Topgrade**: After installation, you can run Topgrade by simply typing `topgrade` in the terminal.

Please note that while Topgrade can streamline the update process, it's essential to ensure that it aligns with Nobara's package management practices to avoid potential system issues. Always back up your system before performing extensive updates.
