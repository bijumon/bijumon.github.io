Run flux kontext dev locally 
## assistant

To run **Flux Kontext** in **development mode locally**, you usually need to clone the repository, install dependencies, and start the development server.

Assuming you are referring to the [Flux Kontext](https://github.com/fluxcd/kontext) project from the FluxCD GitHub organization (used for GitOps context viewing), here's how you can run it locally in dev mode:

---

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites

- [Go (1.21+)](https://go.dev/doc/install)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (16+)
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/)
- Docker (optional for Flux backend mocking)
- Git

---

### üöÄ Steps to Run Flux Kontext Locally

#### 1. **Clone the repo**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fluxcd/kontext.git
cd kontext
```

---

#### 2. **Start the frontend (Kontext UI)**

```bash
cd web
yarn install
yarn dev
```

This will run the frontend on `http://localhost:5173` (Vite dev server).

---

#### 3. **Start the backend (Kontext API)**

The backend is a Go application.

```bash
cd api
go run main.go serve
```

This typically starts a server on `http://localhost:8080`.

> You can run `go run main.go serve --help` to see additional flags like `--port`, `--log-level`, or `--path`.

---

#### 4. **Use sample data or your own**

To test with mock data, you can generate a context file:
```bash
go run main.go export > context.json
```

Or fetch it directly from a cluster if you're running Flux:
```bash
go run main.go export --kubeconfig ~/.kube/config > context.json
```

Then serve it via the backend or load it in the frontend using the appropriate API endpoint.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Developer Tips

- **Hot Reloading**: The frontend uses Vite, so changes reflect instantly.
- **Environment Variables**: Modify `.env` or pass env vars to control the backend/frontend behavior.
- **Docker Compose**: There‚Äôs a `docker-compose.yaml` if you want to spin up both backend and frontend containers together.

---

Let me know if you want help with a specific part like mock data, API customization, or connecting to a real Flux cluster.

Run flux kontext dev model locally 
## assistant

To run the **Flux Kontext dev model** locally, you‚Äôll need to follow a few steps depending on what you mean by ‚ÄúFlux Kontext‚Äù ‚Äî as the name isn't standard across popular open-source projects.

However, assuming you're referring to **Kontext by Flux** (a project related to AI model serving or a dev framework), and you'd like to run its development version locally, here‚Äôs a general outline of what to do ‚Äî assuming it's a GitHub-hosted Python or Node.js-based project:

---

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fluxml/kontext.git
cd kontext
```

(Replace the URL with the correct one if it‚Äôs a different project.)

---

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Check the Dependencies

Most dev projects will have a file like:

- `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` (Python)
- `package.json` (Node.js)

Install accordingly:

#### For Python:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### For Node.js:
```bash
npm install
```

---

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Environment Configuration

Check if there‚Äôs a `.env.example` file. If yes, copy and edit it:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Then edit .env with your editor
```

---

### ‚úÖ Step 4: Start the Dev Server

Try:

```bash
# Python
python main.py
# or Flask/Django/Uvicorn specific:
flask run
# or
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Node.js
npm run dev
```

The actual command might vary ‚Äî check the README or a `Makefile`, or look in `package.json` or `pyproject.toml` for entry points.

---

### ‚úÖ Step 5: Access the App

Typically at:

```
http://localhost:3000  (Node)
http://localhost:8000  (FastAPI)
http://localhost:5000  (Flask)
```

---

### If You're Referring to a Specific Tool (e.g., LLM UI or Agent Platform):

Please clarify if you're referring to:

- **Flux** the deployment/infra tool?
- **Kontext** as a specific AI frontend/backend?
- Something else (a context-aware dev model tool)?

---

If you can give a GitHub link, a screenshot, or clarify what ‚ÄúFlux Kontext‚Äù is (model runner? AI tool? agent orchestrator?), I‚Äôll give you exact copy-paste steps for local dev.
## user
Run flux kontext dev model locally, how much vram and ram
## assistant

Running **Flux Kontext Dev**, a large language model developed by **FluxML**, locally will depend on:

- The **specific variant** of the model (parameter count, quantization)
- Whether you're using **CPU**, **GPU**, or **Apple Silicon**
- The **framework** used (e.g., `Flux.jl` in Julia, or `ggml`/`llama.cpp` format for inference)

However, as of now, there is **no public release of a model explicitly named ‚ÄúFlux Kontext Dev‚Äù** from FluxML or related projects. If you're referring to a **custom or in-house variant**, here‚Äôs a general guide based on local LLM deployment:

---

### üß† **General Memory Requirements for Local LLMs**

| Model Size (Parameters) | VRAM (16-bit FP) | VRAM (8-bit Quantized) | System RAM (swap, cache, weights, etc.) |
|-------------------------|------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| 7B                     | ~14 GB           | ~6‚Äì8 GB                 | 8‚Äì12 GB                                 |
| 13B                    | ~26 GB           | ~10‚Äì14 GB               | 16‚Äì24 GB                                |
| 30B                    | ~60 GB           | ~20‚Äì24 GB               | 32‚Äì48 GB                                |
| 65B                    | ~130 GB          | ~40‚Äì48 GB               | 64‚Äì96 GB                                |

> Note: These are ballpark figures. Using quantized models (like GGUF with llama.cpp or llama-cpp-python) will dramatically reduce GPU memory usage.

---

### ‚úÖ **For Local Inference with GGUF/Llama.cpp**

If ‚ÄúFlux Kontext Dev‚Äù is exported to GGUF or a llama.cpp-compatible format:

- **7B model (Q4_K_M or Q5_K_M)**:  
  - VRAM: 4‚Äì6 GB  
  - RAM: 6‚Äì8 GB

- **13B model (Q4_K_M)**:  
  - VRAM: 8‚Äì10 GB  
  - RAM: 12‚Äì16 GB

These fit well on **consumer GPUs like RTX 3060 (12GB), 4060 Ti (16GB), or Apple M1/M2** with Metal backend.

---

### üîß How to Run It Locally

1. **Install llama.cpp or llama-cpp-python**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp
   cd llama.cpp && make
   ```

2. **Download the model (GGUF format)**:
   If available as a `.gguf` file, place it in the `models` directory.

3. **Run the model**:
   ```bash
   ./main -m models/flux-kontext-dev.gguf -p "Your prompt here"
   ```

---

### üí° Tips

- **Use quantized models** (Q4_0, Q5_K_M) for lower VRAM usage.
- On **CPU-only machines**, use Q4 or Q2 quant models but expect slower speeds.
- Enable **offloading** if partial GPU support is available.

---

If you have a link or parameter count for "Flux Kontext Dev", I can give exact numbers. Could you clarify:
- The model source (GitHub? Hugging Face?)
- The parameter size or quantization?
- Are you using Julia (`Flux.jl`) or an inference tool (like llama.cpp)?
## assistant

The **Flux Kontext** development model (from FluxML/Julia ecosystem) is an open-source transformer-style model. To run it **locally**, the **VRAM and RAM requirements** depend heavily on:

- The **model size** (e.g., base, small, large, etc.)
- Whether you're using **FP32, BF16, or quantized** versions
- Batch size and sequence length
- Whether inference or training is being done

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Typical VRAM & RAM Requirements (for Inference)

Here's a rough estimate for **inference** using the **base `kontext` model**:

| Model Size | RAM (System) | VRAM (GPU, FP16) | Notes |
|------------|---------------|------------------|-------|
| Kontext Small (~125M params) | ~1‚Äì2 GB | ~1 GB | Easily fits on most consumer GPUs |
| Kontext Base (~350M params) | ~2‚Äì4 GB | ~2‚Äì3 GB | Fits on GPUs with ‚â•4GB VRAM |
| Kontext Large (~1.3B params) | ~6‚Äì8 GB | ~6‚Äì8 GB | Needs GPUs like RTX 3060 12GB or better |
| Kontext XL (~6B params) | ~12‚Äì20 GB | ~20+ GB | Requires A100, 3090, or similar |

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è These are for **inference only**. Training requires much more VRAM and RAM ‚Äî usually 2‚Äì4√ó the above values.

---

### üß™ Running Locally (Dev Setup)

To run locally (e.g., using Julia & Flux), your environment might look like this:

- **Julia version**: ‚â•1.9 recommended
- **Flux.jl** and **CUDA.jl** if running on GPU
- **ONNX.jl** or **Transformers.jl** if using pre-trained or converted models

#### Minimum local hardware for dev testing:
- CPU: 4+ cores
- RAM: ‚â•8 GB (16 GB preferred)
- GPU (optional): NVIDIA GPU with ‚â•4 GB VRAM
- Disk: 2‚Äì4 GB free for model weights

---

### üß† Tips for Lower VRAM:
- Use **CPU-only** for dev and tests (Flux can do this natively)
- Quantize the model to **Int8 or BF16** if possible
- Use **smaller batch sizes** and shorter input sequences
- Run **truncated models** (fewer layers) for development

---

Would you like help setting up a specific `kontext` variant on your machine? You can share your specs (CPU, GPU, RAM), and I‚Äôll give you a tailored setup plan.
## assistant

Running the **Flux Kontext Dev** model locally depends on a few factors, but here are the general hardware requirements based on what‚Äôs known about the model (assuming you're referring to the **Flux Kontext language model** or something similar in scale):

---

### ‚úÖ **Minimum Requirements (for local inference)**
For basic **CPU-only** inference (very slow):
- **RAM**: 8‚Äì16 GB system RAM
- **VRAM**: Not required (CPU inference)

---

### ‚úÖ **GPU-based Inference (for reasonable speed)**
Assuming the dev model is a **small to medium transformer**, like a distilled or 1B-3B parameter model:

#### ‚û§ **Small Dev Models (~1B params or less)**  
- **VRAM**: ~4‚Äì6 GB (NVIDIA GTX 1660 Super, RTX 2060, etc.)
- **RAM**: 8‚Äì16 GB system RAM

#### ‚û§ **Medium Models (2B‚Äì3B)**  
- **VRAM**: 8‚Äì12 GB (e.g. RTX 3060, 3080, A4000)
- **RAM**: 16‚Äì32 GB system RAM

#### ‚û§ **Larger Dev Models (6B‚Äì7B like LLaMA 7B)**  
- **VRAM**: 16 GB (minimum with quantization, e.g. RTX 4090, A6000)
- **RAM**: 32+ GB system RAM  
- Needs quantization (e.g. GGUF, GPTQ) or offloading with tools like **LLama.cpp**, **vLLM**, or **ExLlama**

---

### üîß Tools & Frameworks for Local Inference
Depending on the format of the dev model, you may run it using:
- `llama.cpp` (GGUF models, very RAM/VRAM efficient, even runs on CPU)
- `text-generation-webui` (flexible GUI for multiple backends)
- `transformers` + `optimum` + `onnxruntime` (for optimized inference)
- `vllm` (for fast inference with GPU)

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes
- Always check the **model card** or GitHub README of "Flux Kontext Dev" for exact requirements.
- Use **quantized versions** (4-bit/8-bit) to reduce VRAM and RAM usage.

---

If you tell me more about the model‚Äôs size (parameter count, type, or where it's from), I can give you more specific advice.
## user
how do i run the gguf models using llama.cpp and which one do i run
## assistant
To run **GGUF models** using `llama.cpp`, follow these steps:

---

## üß† What is `llama.cpp`?
`llama.cpp` is a high-performance C++ inference engine for LLaMA and similar models in **GGUF** format. It runs on CPU or GPU (OpenBLAS, cuBLAS, Metal, etc.).

---

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

### 1. **System Requirements (for CPU)**
- **RAM**: 8‚Äì16 GB for small models, 32+ GB for 7B+
- No GPU needed (though GPU is faster)

### 2. **Install Dependencies**
On **Linux/macOS**:

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential cmake
```

On **Fedora**:

```bash
sudo dnf install cmake make gcc
```

---

## üîß Step-by-Step: Run GGUF Model with `llama.cpp`

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Clone and Build `llama.cpp`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp
cd llama.cpp
make -j
```

> Optional: For GPU support (CUDA), run `LLAMA_CUBLAS=1 make -j`

---

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Download a GGUF Model

Pick a model from **[Hugging Face - TheBloke](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke)** or similar source.

Popular models:
- `TheBloke/LLaMA-2-7B-GGUF`
- `TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1-GGUF`
- `TheBloke/TinyLlama-1.1B-GGUF` (small, for low RAM)

Download a 4-bit (Q4_0, Q4_K_M, or Q5) or 5-bit version for less memory use.

Example (Mistral 7B):

```bash
wget https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1-GGUF/resolve/main/mistral-7b-instruct-v0.1.Q4_K_M.gguf -O model.gguf
```

---

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Run the Model

```bash
./main -m model.gguf -p "Hello, how are you?" -n 100
```

### Parameters:
- `-m`: Path to GGUF model
- `-p`: Prompt
- `-n`: Number of tokens to generate

---

## üß™ Example: Use Interactive Chat Mode

```bash
./chat -m model.gguf
```

You can now chat with the model in terminal!

---

## üî• Advanced: GPU Acceleration

If you have an NVIDIA GPU:
1. Install CUDA
2. Build with CUDA:

```bash
make clean
LLAMA_CUBLAS=1 make -j
```

This uses cuBLAS backend for faster inference.

---

## üìå What Model Should You Use?

| Use Case         | Model Name                                 | RAM Need | Notes                              |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------|-------------------------------------|
| Very low RAM     | TinyLlama-1.1B GGUF                        | 4 GB     | Slow but very light                 |
| Fast + small     | Mistral 7B Q4_K_M                          | 12‚Äì16 GB | Good speed/accuracy tradeoff        |
| Strong answers   | LLaMA 2 7B Q5_1 GGUF                       | 16‚Äì20 GB | Slightly heavier, very capable      |
| Instruction tuned| Nous Hermes 2, OpenHermes, Zephyr, etc.   | 16+ GB   | Better for chat/conversations       |

---

Would you like me to suggest a model based on your **VRAM or RAM**?
## user
how do i run the gguf models using llama.cpp and which flux kontext gguf
## assistant
To run **GGUF models** (such as *Flux Kontext*) using `llama.cpp`, you need to follow a few clear steps. Here's a breakdown:

---

## ‚úÖ 1. **Set Up `llama.cpp`**
Clone and build llama.cpp from source.

### üîß Install dependencies:
```bash
# On Fedora
sudo dnf install cmake gcc make git
```

### üß± Clone and build:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp.git
cd llama.cpp
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config Release
```

---

## ‚úÖ 2. **Download a GGUF Model**
You mentioned *Flux Kontext* ‚Äî as of now (July 2025), there's **no public GGUF release** officially named *Flux Kontext* on Hugging Face or other mainstream model hubs (as far as widely indexed). So first:

### üîç Confirm the exact model name
- If you have a **private Flux Kontext** or custom model in GGUF format, you can use it directly.
- If not, and you meant something **similar or general-purpose**, try downloading one from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke) in GGUF format. Example:
  - LLaMA 3 GGUF: `TheBloke/Llama-3-8B-Instruct-GGUF`
  - TinyLLama, Mistral, etc.

Example with `wget`:
```bash
wget https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-3-8B-Instruct-GGUF/resolve/main/llama-3-8b-instruct.Q4_K_M.gguf
```

---

## ‚úÖ 3. **Run Inference Using `llama.cpp`**
Use the `main` executable to chat or test prompts.

```bash
./main -m ./llama-3-8b-instruct.Q4_K_M.gguf -p "What is Flux Kontext?" -n 256
```

You can add:
- `-t 4` for 4 threads
- `--color` for colored output
- `--interactive` to run chat mode

---

## ‚úÖ 4. **Optional: Use `chat` or `server` modes**
You can also run:
```bash
./chat -m ./your-model.gguf
```
Or start a web server:
```bash
./server -m ./your-model.gguf
```
Then open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

---

## üîç If You're Looking for *Flux Kontext GGUF* Specifically:
Please confirm:
- Do you have a **model checkpoint** or link to download Flux Kontext GGUF?
- Is it hosted on Hugging Face or another hub?
- What's the **parameter size** (e.g., 1.3B, 3B, etc.)?

I can help you convert to GGUF or locate the correct file if it exists.

---

Would you like help searching for a GGUF of Flux Kontext online right now?
## assistant
To run **GGUF models** (like a *Flux Kontext* model) using **`llama.cpp`**, follow these steps:

---

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step: Run GGUF Models with llama.cpp

### **1. Clone and build llama.cpp**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp.git
cd llama.cpp
make -j$(nproc)
```

> ‚úÖ This builds a CPU-only version. For GPU (CUDA/OpenCL/Metal), see GPU notes below.

---

### **2. Download a GGUF model (e.g. Flux Kontext)**
Currently, there‚Äôs **no widely known "Flux Kontext" GGUF model** on Hugging Face or elsewhere under that exact name (as of July 2025). You may have meant:
- A *custom local model* you've converted to GGUF
- A *small language model family* called "Kontext" or "Flux" (possibly private or lesser-known)

üîç You can browse known GGUF models at:
- [https://huggingface.co/TheBloke](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke) (search "GGUF")
- [https://huggingface.co/models?library=llama.cpp&sort=downloads](https://huggingface.co/models?library=llama.cpp)

If you have a `.gguf` file already, skip to step 3.

---

### **3. Place GGUF model in the correct folder**
```bash
mkdir models
mv your_model.gguf models/
```

---

### **4. Run the model**
```bash
./main -m models/your_model.gguf -p "Hello, who are you?"
```

Use `-n 256` to control number of tokens to generate.

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Optional: GPU Acceleration

To enable **GPU acceleration**, rebuild with:

### For CUDA (NVIDIA GPUs):
```bash
make clean
LLAMA_CUBLAS=1 make -j$(nproc)
```

### For OpenCL (AMD/Intel GPUs):
```bash
make clean
LLAMA_CLBLAST=1 make -j$(nproc)
```

You may also need to tweak `ggml_cuda.cu` or ensure dependencies like `clblast` are installed.

Then run:
```bash
./main -m models/your_model.gguf -ngl 35 -p "Start prompt..."
```
- `-ngl 35` offloads 35 layers to GPU (adjust depending on VRAM)

---

## üîÑ Convert Model to GGUF (if needed)
If you have a model in HF Transformers format:
1. Use `transformers` + `transformers-to-gguf`
   ```bash
   pip install transformers transformers-cli huggingface_hub
   git clone https://github.com/ggerganov/transformers-to-gguf
   cd transformers-to-gguf
   python convert.py path_to_model --outfile your_model.gguf
   ```

---

## üß† Which "Flux Kontext" model is GGUF?

As of now, **there's no public GGUF version** of a model named **"Flux Kontext"**. Please confirm:
- Do you have a link to the model repo?
- Is it from Hugging Face, private repo, or another site?
- Is it possibly a local name or custom fine-tuned model?

If you can share more about the model (link or size or file), I can help you convert or run it properly.
## user
how do i run the gguf models using llama.cpp and which flux kontext gguf. i dont think llama.cpp uses main binaries anymore, gimme updated info
## assistant
You're absolutely right ‚Äî `llama.cpp` has moved on from `main` binaries like `main` or `main-chat` and now uses a unified and **modular CLI tool** (usually just called `llama`). Let's break this down with the **latest setup as of mid‚Äì2025**:

---

## ‚úÖ How to Run GGUF Models with `llama.cpp` (Updated)

### üîß 1. **Clone & Build `llama.cpp`**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp
cd llama.cpp
make
```

This builds the `llama` binary in the root of the repo using the default compiler and optimization.

> üß† Optionally: `make LLAMA_CUBLAS=1` for CUDA/GPU support (requires CUDA toolkit).  
> For AMD: use ROCm backend or fallback to CPU.

---

### üìÇ 2. **Get a GGUF Model**
For **Flux Kontext**, check if it‚Äôs published in GGUF format. If not:

- Try their Hugging Face model page (if public)
- Look for conversions (e.g., via `transformers` ‚Üí `gguf` using scripts like `convert.py` from `llama.cpp/tools/convert.py`)
  
If it's available, it‚Äôll be a `.gguf` file like:

```bash
models/flux-kontext-dev/flux-kontext-dev.Q4_K_M.gguf
```

You can also find models on:

- https://huggingface.co/TheBloke (popular for quantized GGUFs)
- https://gguf.chat

---

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è 3. **Run the Model**

```bash
./llama -m models/flux-kontext-dev.Q4_K_M.gguf
```

It will drop into a prompt where you can type interactively.

#### Example with system prompt:
```bash
./llama -m models/flux-kontext-dev.Q4_K_M.gguf \
  --prompt "You are Flux, a helpful assistant. Answer briefly." \
  -n 200
```

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Optional Useful Flags
| Flag             | Description                                 |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `-m`             | Path to `.gguf` model                       |
| `--prompt`       | Prompt to start with                        |
| `--n-predict` / `-n` | Max tokens to generate                |
| `--temperature`  | Controls randomness (lower = deterministic) |
| `--repeat-penalty` | Controls repetition                       |
| `--ctx-size`     | Context window size                         |
| `--threads`      | Number of CPU threads to use                |

---

### üß™ 4. **Benchmark VRAM/RAM Usage**
To estimate requirements:
```bash
./llama -m your-model.gguf --info
```
It will tell you context size, memory usage per layer, and model size in RAM/VRAM.

---

## üì¶ Where Is Flux Kontext GGUF?

As of now, **Flux Kontext** doesn‚Äôt appear in common GGUF repositories or Hugging Face under that name. It may be:

- A **proprietary or private dev model**
- Available only in original PyTorch/HF format (which you‚Äôll need to convert)

> üîÑ If you give me the Hugging Face link or format of the Flux Kontext model, I can guide you through **converting it to GGUF** for `llama.cpp`.

---

## üîÑ Convert HF Model to GGUF (if needed)

If you have the model in Hugging Face Transformers format:

```bash
# Inside llama.cpp
python3 convert.py /path/to/hf-model-dir --outfile output-model.gguf
```

You'll need:
- Model `.bin` or `.safetensors`
- `config.json`
- `tokenizer.model` or `tokenizer.json`

---

Let me know the exact model name (or Hugging Face link), and I‚Äôll give you exact steps to run *that specific GGUF* or convert it.

## assistant
That error means your `llama.cpp` build is **outdated** or **incomplete** ‚Äî specifically, the `llama` binary you‚Äôre using is missing the new `ggml_backend_load_all` symbol, which is required in recent versions of `llama.cpp` (mid‚Äì2025).

---

## ‚úÖ Fix: Clean Rebuild of `llama.cpp`

Here‚Äôs how to correctly rebuild everything from scratch:

---

### üîÅ 1. **Clean up first**
```bash
cd llama.cpp
make clean
```

---

### üõ†Ô∏è 2. **Rebuild the correct binary**

**For CPU only:**
```bash
make -j
```

**For GPU (CUDA):**
```bash
make LLAMA_CUBLAS=1 -j
```

> üîπ You can also try `LLAMA_OPENBLAS=1` or `LLAMA_CLBLAST=1` depending on your setup.

---

### üß™ 3. **Verify the new binary**

Once built, you should see a new binary named simply:

```bash
llama
```

Run:
```bash
./llama --help
```
If it works, the undefined symbol error is fixed.

---

## üßæ Explanation

The error:
```
symbol lookup error: llama-cli: undefined symbol: ggml_backend_load_all
```
...means the `llama-cli` binary is **compiled against an older or mismatched version** of the `ggml` library. `ggml_backend_load_all()` is a **recent addition** used in backend loading (like for Metal, CUDA, etc.). You **must rebuild the CLI with the latest sources.**

---

## üßº Optional: Remove Old Binaries

If you've installed old `llama-cli`, uninstall it or delete it:
```bash
which llama-cli
# or
find ~/.local/bin -name "llama*"
```

Use only the binary from your fresh `llama.cpp` build.

Let me know if you're using a custom backend (like ROCm or Metal), and I can give you tailored build flags.
