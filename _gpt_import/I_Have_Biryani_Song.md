## assistant

**I Have Biryani** *(to the tune of Whitney Houston’s "I Have Nothing")*  

**[Verse 1]**  
Share my plate, take my naan  
But don't you dare touch what’s in my hand  
Spiced to taste, slow-cooked right  
This fragrant love is my guiding light  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Don't make me choose between my heart and food  
I’d walk away, but I know I should  
Stay right here with my saffron dreams  
I can’t live without this feast supreme  

**[Chorus]**  
I have biryani, don’t need nothing else  
Every grain is heaven, every bite is felt  
If I lose it now, I will fade away  
So just let me stay...  
With my biryani  

**[Verse 2]**  
Marinated love, layered with care  
Tender meat and steam in the air  
Golden rice, cashews too  
No other dish will ever do  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Don’t make me share, don’t you take my spoon  
One more bite and I’ll be over the moon  
Spicy, rich, it’s my one true need  
This is fate, not just gluttony  

**[Chorus]**  
I have biryani, don’t need nothing else  
Every grain is heaven, every bite is felt  
If I lose it now, I will fade away  
So just let me stay...  
With my biryani  

**[Bridge]**  
No regrets, no compromise  
Just one more plate and I'll touch the skies  
Ohhh, don’t you dare say diet now  
This love is too deep to deny somehow  

**[Final Chorus]**  
I have biryani, don’t need nothing else  
Flavors so divine, make my heart melt  
If you take it now, I will break apart  
So just let me guard...  
My biryani  

**[Outro]**  
Stay with me, stay with me  
Ohhh, my biryani

**I HAVE BIRIYANI**  
*(To the tune and grandeur of Whitney Houston’s “I Have Nothing”)*  

**[Verse 1]**  
Share my plate, take my spoon  
Every grain of rice is a gift from the moon  
Tender spice, slow embrace  
Saffron dreams wrapped in warm, steamy taste  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Don't make me order something else tonight  
I don’t need naan, I don’t want plain rice  
Stay in my life, oh, fragrant delight  
Or I will starve—don't make me choose twice  

**[Chorus]**  
I have biriyani—it's all that I need  
No more hunger, no more sorrow, it's destiny  
Don't walk away, don’t take it from me  
I have biriyani, I have biriyani  

**[Verse 2]**  
Golden glow, chicken deep  
Lamb so tender, it melts in my dreams  
Caramelized onions shine  
Raita cools where the chili burns bright  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Don't serve me salad, don’t serve me fries  
Only one love sets my soul on fire  
Spiced to perfection, slow-cooked divine  
If I lose this, I'd rather just cry  

**[Chorus]**  
I have biriyani—it's all that I need  
No more hunger, no more sorrow, it's destiny  
Don’t walk away, don’t take it from me  
I have biriyani, I have biriyani  

**[Bridge]**  
Nothing compares, nothing comes close  
Every bite’s like a hug for my soul  
Tandoor can wait, curry can go  
Just leave me alone—with my biriyani glow  

**[Final Chorus]**  
I have biriyani—it's love on a plate  
Aromatic devotion I just can't escape  
Don’t walk away, don’t take it from me  
I have biriyani, I have biriyani…  

*(Fade out with emotional humming and a final whispered… “extra raita, please…”)

Would totally be a power ballad for the ages.
