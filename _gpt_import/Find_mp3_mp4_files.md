find mp3 or mp4 files in home dir, exclusing steamapps directory
## assistant

You can use the `find` command in Linux to locate `.mp3` and `.mp4` files in your home directory while **excluding** the `steamapps` directory.

Here's the command:

```bash
find ~/ -path ~/steamapps -prune -o \( -iname "*.mp3" -o -iname "*.mp4" \) -type f -print
```

### Explanation:
- `find ~/`: Start searching from your home directory.
- `-path ~/steamapps -prune`: Skip (do not descend into) the `steamapps` directory.
- `-o`: OR condition.
- `\(...\)`: Group the OR conditions.
- `-iname "*.mp3"`: Match `.mp3` files (case-insensitive).
- `-o -iname "*.mp4"`: OR `.mp4` files (case-insensitive).
- `-type f`: Ensure it's a file.
- `-print`: Print the matched files.

### Notes:
- If `steamapps` is deeper (e.g., `~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps`), use:
  
  ```bash
  find ~/ -path ~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps -prune -o \( -iname "*.mp3" -o -iname "*.mp4" \) -type f -print
  ```

Let me know if you want to exclude multiple directories.
## user
find webm, opus, flac, mp3 or mp4 files in home dir, exclusing Steam directory
## assistant

You can use the `find` command in the terminal to search for specific file types in your home directory, while excluding the Steam directory. Here's a command that does that:

```bash
find ~/ \( -path ~/Steam -o -path ~/.steam \) -prune -o -type f \( -iname "*.webm" -o -iname "*.opus" -o -iname "*.flac" -o -iname "*.mp3" -o -iname "*.mp4" \) -print
```

### Explanation:

- `find ~/` ‚Äî start searching in your home directory.
- `\( -path ~/Steam -o -path ~/.steam \) -prune` ‚Äî exclude the `Steam` and `.steam` directories.
- `-o` ‚Äî logical OR to continue search after pruning.
- `-type f` ‚Äî only look for files.
- `\( -iname "*.ext" ... \)` ‚Äî match files with given extensions, case-insensitive.
- `-print` ‚Äî display the matching files.

### Optional: Sort results or save to file

To **sort results**:
```bash
... | sort
```

To **save results to a file**:
```bash
... > found_media_files.txt
```

Let me know if you want to include/exclude other folders or use a GUI-friendly alternative.
## assistant

To find files with extensions `.webm`, `.opus`, `.flac`, `.mp3`, or `.mp4` in your **home directory**, while **excluding the Steam directory**, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
find ~/ -path ~/Steam -prune -o \( -type f \( -iname "*.webm" -o -iname "*.opus" -o -iname "*.flac" -o -iname "*.mp3" -o -iname "*.mp4" \) -print \)
```

### Explanation:
- `find ~/` ‚Äî start searching in your home directory.
- `-path ~/Steam -prune` ‚Äî skip (prune) the `~/Steam` directory.
- `-o` ‚Äî OR operator, required to combine pruned path with the actual search.
- `\( -type f ‚Ä¶ \)` ‚Äî group the condition to find files of the listed types.
- `-iname "*.ext"` ‚Äî case-insensitive match for each extension.
- `-print` ‚Äî print the result only if not pruned.

### Alternative: Exclude any folder with "Steam" in path
If the Steam folder could be in a different location like `~/.local/share/Steam`, use:

```bash
find ~/ \( -path "*/Steam/*" -o -path "*/steam/*" \) -prune -o \( -type f \( -iname "*.webm" -o -iname "*.opus" -o -iname "*.flac" -o -iname "*.mp3" -o -iname "*.mp4" \) -print \)
```

Let me know if you want this saved as a script or want it to also show file sizes or durations.
## user
find webm, opus, flac, mp3 or mp4 files in home dir, exclusing Steam directory. give me examples in find and fd
## assistant

Here are examples of how to find files with specific extensions (`.webm`, `.opus`, `.flac`, `.mp3`, `.mp4`) in your home directory **excluding** the `Steam` directory, using both `find` and `fd`.

---

### ‚úÖ Using `find`

```bash
find ~/ -type f \( -iname "*.webm" -o -iname "*.opus" -o -iname "*.flac" -o -iname "*.mp3" -o -iname "*.mp4" \) \
  -not -path "$HOME/.steam/*" -not -path "$HOME/.local/share/Steam/*"
```

**Explanation**:
- `-type f`: Only files
- `-iname`: Case-insensitive match for extensions
- `-not -path`: Exclude Steam directories (both common paths)

---

### ‚úÖ Using `fd` (a simpler, faster alternative)

```bash
fd -e webm -e opus -e flac -e mp3 -e mp4 ~ --exclude '.steam' --exclude 'Steam'
```

**Explanation**:
- `-e`: Specify extensions (you can use it multiple times)
- `~`: Search in home directory
- `--exclude`: Ignore matching paths
  - `--exclude '.steam'`: Excludes `~/.steam`
  - `--exclude 'Steam'`: Matches both `Steam` and `.local/share/Steam`

You can also use a regex with `fd` for more complex matching:

```bash
fd '.*\.(webm|opus|flac|mp3|mp4)$' ~ --exclude '.steam' --exclude 'Steam'
```

---

Let me know if you want to:
- Only search specific directories like `~/Music` or `~/Videos`
- Show file sizes or sort by time/size
## assistant

Here are examples using both `find` and `fd` to search for files with extensions like `.webm`, `.opus`, `.flac`, `.mp3`, or `.mp4` in your home directory **excluding the Steam directory** (usually `~/Steam` or `~/.steam`).

---

## ‚úÖ Using `find`

```bash
find ~/ -type f \( -iname "*.webm" -o -iname "*.opus" -o -iname "*.flac" -o -iname "*.mp3" -o -iname "*.mp4" \) \
  -not -path "$HOME/Steam/*" -not -path "$HOME/.steam/*"
```

### Explanation:
- `-type f` ‚Äî regular files only
- `\( ‚Ä¶ -o ‚Ä¶ \)` ‚Äî match any of the listed extensions (OR)
- `-not -path` ‚Äî exclude paths under Steam
- Use quotes around paths and extensions to handle spaces and globs safely.

---

## ‚úÖ Using `fd` (faster and simpler, if installed)

```bash
fd -e webm -e opus -e flac -e mp3 -e mp4 ~ \
  --exclude Steam --exclude .steam
```

### Explanation:
- `-e` ‚Äî extension filter
- `~` ‚Äî search root directory (your home)
- `--exclude` ‚Äî ignores matching directories anywhere in the path

---

Let me know if you want the results saved to a file or filtered by size/date etc.
## user
find directory name __MACOSX exactly
## assistant
To find a directory named exactly `__MACOSX`, use the following command:

### ‚úÖ Using `find`:
```bash
find ~ -type d -name '__MACOSX'
```

### Explanation:
- `~` ‚Äî searches in your home directory
- `-type d` ‚Äî only directories
- `-name '__MACOSX'` ‚Äî matches the directory name exactly (case-sensitive)

---

### Optional: case-insensitive match
If you want to match `__macosx` or `__MacOSX` too:

```bash
find ~ -type d -iname '__macosx'
```

Let me know if you want to delete these folders or archive them.
## user
find directory name __MACOSX exactly and show their individual and combined sized
## assistant
You can use the `find` command along with `du` to locate directories named `__MACOSX` **exactly**, then show **each size individually** and a **total combined size**.

---

### ‚úÖ **Command to run:**

```bash
find ~ -type d -name '__MACOSX' -print0 | tee /tmp/macosx_dirs.txt | xargs -0 du -sh
```

### ‚úÖ **To get combined total size only:**

```bash
find ~ -type d -name '__MACOSX' -print0 | xargs -0 du -sb | awk '{sum += $1} END {printf "Total: %.2f MB\n", sum/1024/1024}'
```

---

### üîç Explanation:

- `find ~ -type d -name '__MACOSX'` ‚Äî find directories named `__MACOSX`
- `-print0` and `xargs -0` ‚Äî safely handle paths with spaces/newlines
- `du -sh` ‚Äî show **human-readable size** for each directory
- `du -sb` ‚Äî show **raw bytes** (for summing)
- `awk` ‚Äî adds up the sizes and converts to MB

---

Let me know if you want to delete those directories after review.
