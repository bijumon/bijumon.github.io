To remove all Docker containers, images, volumes, and networks, you can use the following commands. These steps will clear out all Docker-related data on your system.

1. **Stop all running containers** (optional if you want to stop them before removing):
   ```bash
   docker stop $(docker ps -aq)
   ```

2. **Remove all containers**:
   ```bash
   docker rm $(docker ps -aq)
   ```

3. **Remove all images**:
   ```bash
   docker rmi $(docker images -q)
   ```

4. **Remove all volumes**:
   ```bash
   docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -q)
   ```

5. **Remove all networks** (except the default ones):
   ```bash
   docker network rm $(docker network ls | grep -v "bridge\|host\|none" | awk '{print $1}')
   ```

6. **Remove unused data** (optional to clean up dangling resources):
   ```bash
   docker system prune -a --volumes
   ```

> **Warning:** These commands will permanently delete all Docker data, including images, containers, volumes, and networks. Use with caution.
