python check for empty line

To check for an empty line in Python, you can use a simple conditional statement. Here’s how you can do it:

```python
line = "your string here"

# Check if the line is empty or consists only of whitespace
if line.strip() == "":
    print("The line is empty.")
else:
    print("The line is not empty.")
```

- `line.strip()` removes any leading and trailing whitespace, so it will treat lines containing only spaces or tabs as empty.

If you want to check multiple lines (like from a file or a list), you can loop through them:

```python
lines = ["first line", "", "   ", "last line"]

for i, line in enumerate(lines):
    if line.strip() == "":
        print(f"Line {i} is empty.")
    else:
        print(f"Line {i} is not empty.")
```

This will output whether each line in the list is empty or not.

To check if a line is empty, regardless of whether it contains only spaces or tabs, you can use Python. Here’s a snippet that demonstrates this:

```python
def is_empty_line(line):
    return len(line.strip()) == 0

# Test cases
lines = [
    "",            # Empty line
    "    ",        # Line with spaces
    "\t",          # Line with a tab
    "  \t  ",      # Line with spaces and a tab
    "text"         # Non-empty line
]

# Check each line
results = [is_empty_line(line) for line in lines]
results
```

### Explanation:
- The `strip()` method removes any leading and trailing whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines, etc.).
- If `strip()` results in an empty string (`""`), the line is considered empty.

This code will return `True` for lines that are empty or only contain spaces/tabs and `False` for non-empty lines.

You can check for an empty line in Python, whether it contains just spaces or tabs, by using the `strip()` method. This method removes leading and trailing whitespace (including spaces and tabs), and then you can check if the resulting string is empty. Here's an example:

```python
def is_empty_line(line):
    return line.strip() == ""

# Example usage
lines = [
    "    ",    # Line with spaces
    "\t\t",   # Line with tabs
    "",       # Completely empty line
    "Hello",  # Non-empty line
]

for i, line in enumerate(lines):
    if is_empty_line(line):
        print(f"Line {i} is empty.")
    else:
        print(f"Line {i} is not empty.")
```

This code will correctly identify lines that are either completely empty or contain only whitespace (spaces or tabs) as empty lines.

To check if a line is empty (i.e., it only contains spaces, tabs, or nothing at all), you can use the following Python code:

```python
def is_empty_line(line):
    # Strip the line of any leading and trailing whitespace (spaces, tabs, etc.)
    stripped_line = line.strip()
    # Check if the stripped line is empty
    return len(stripped_line) == 0

# Test cases
lines = [
    "    ",      # Only spaces
    "\t\t",     # Only tabs
    "   \t   ", # Mix of spaces and tabs
    "\n",       # Just a newline character
    "",         # An empty string
    "Not empty" # Non-empty line
]

# Check each line
results = [is_empty_line(line) for line in lines]
results
```

This function, `is_empty_line`, returns `True` if the line is considered empty and `False` otherwise. 

- It uses the `strip()` method to remove all leading and trailing whitespace characters, including spaces and tabs.
- After stripping, if the length of the line is zero, it is considered empty.
