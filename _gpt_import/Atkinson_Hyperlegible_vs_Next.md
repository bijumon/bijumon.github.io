What's the difference between Atkinson Hyperlegible and next
## assistant

Could you clarify what you mean by "next"? Are you referring to another specific font, like Frutiger Next, or do you mean the next version of Atkinson Hyperlegible?
## assistant

It looks like you're asking about the difference between **Atkinson Hyperlegible** and **Next**, but "Next" isn't a specific font name that I can associate directly. Could you clarify which "Next" font you mean? Are you referring to **Helvetica Next, Frutiger Next, or Neue Haas Grotesk (Next version of Helvetica)**?  

Meanwhile, here's a brief about **Atkinson Hyperlegible**:  

- It was developed by the Braille Institute to enhance readability, especially for people with visual impairments.  
- It focuses on **maximizing legibility** by differentiating similar letterforms (e.g., distinguishing between 'I' and 'l' more clearly).  
- It uses **strong contrast and unique letter shapes** to improve recognition.  
- It's free and open-source.  

If you're referring to a specific "Next" font, let me know, and I can compare it directly!
