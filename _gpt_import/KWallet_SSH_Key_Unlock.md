To have **KWalletManager** unlock your SSH keys on login, you can integrate KWallet with your SSH agent. Follow these steps:

---

### **1. Install Necessary Packages**
Make sure you have `kwallet` and `ssh-agent` installed. On most Linux distributions, these are typically included with KDE Plasma, but you can confirm by checking:

```bash
sudo apt install kwalletmanager ssh-agent    # For Debian-based distros
sudo dnf install kwalletmanager ssh-agent    # For Fedora-based distros
```

---

### **2. Enable KWallet SSH Agent Integration**
KWallet provides an SSH agent integration option that allows it to manage your SSH keys. Here's how to enable it:

1. Open **System Settings** in KDE.
2. Navigate to **Account Details** → **KDE Wallet**.
3. Enable **Enable KWallet subsystem** if it’s not already checked.
4. Go to the **Advanced** tab.
5. Ensure **Use KWallet to store and manage SSH keys** is checked.

---

### **3. Add SSH Keys to KWallet**
1. Add your private SSH key to the wallet:
   ```bash
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
   ```
   Replace `~/.ssh/id_rsa` with the path to your SSH private key, if different.

2. If KWallet integration is active, your SSH key will be stored in the wallet.

---

### **4. Ensure KWallet Unlocks on Login**
To ensure KWallet unlocks on login:

1. Set a KDE wallet password to match your system login password:
   - Open **KWalletManager**.
   - Select your wallet (usually named "kdewallet").
   - Change the password to match your system password via **Settings** → **Change Password**.
2. Alternatively, enable **Automatic Login** for seamless unlocking.

---

### **5. Test the Setup**
1. Reboot your system.
2. On login, verify that your SSH keys are automatically loaded:
   ```bash
   ssh-add -l
   ```
   This should list your loaded SSH keys.

This setup ensures KWallet unlocks on login and manages your SSH keys securely. Let me know if you encounter any issues!

To configure KWalletManager to automatically unlock and manage your SSH keys on login, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
1. **KWalletManager** - KDE's wallet manager.
2. **ssh-agent or gpg-agent** - For managing SSH keys.
3. **KWallet integration** - KDE system settings.

---

### Steps to Unlock SSH on Login

#### 1. **Enable SSH Integration in KWalletManager**
   1. Open **KWalletManager**.
   2. Go to the **Settings** menu and select **Configure Wallet**.
   3. Under the **General** section, ensure **Enable SSH Key Management** is checked.

#### 2. **Configure KDE to Unlock KWallet Automatically**
   1. Open **System Settings** → **Account Details** → **KDE Wallet**.
   2. Ensure the option **Enable the KDE wallet subsystem** is checked.
   3. Select **Open KWallet automatically on login**.
   4. Ensure the wallet's password matches your system login password or set up **PAM integration** (explained below).

#### 3. **Set Up PAM Integration for KWallet**
   PAM (Pluggable Authentication Module) can automatically unlock KWallet when you log in:
   1. Install the required packages for PAM KWallet integration:
      ```bash
      sudo apt install kwallet-pam  # For Debian-based systems
      sudo dnf install kwallet-pam  # For Fedora
      sudo pacman -S kwallet-pam    # For Arch-based systems
      ```
   2. Ensure the following lines are present in `/etc/pam.d/sddm` or `/etc/pam.d/kde` (depending on your display manager):
      ```plaintext
      auth    optional    pam_kwallet5.so
      session optional    pam_kwallet5.so auto_start
      ```
   3. Restart your system to apply changes.

#### 4. **Add Your SSH Keys to KWallet**
   1. Run the following command to add your SSH key to the wallet:
      ```bash
      ssh-add -k ~/.ssh/id_rsa
      ```
   2. This will prompt KWallet to store the key's passphrase.

#### 5. **Start ssh-agent at Login**
   - Ensure the `ssh-agent` or `gpg-agent` is running when you log in:
     1. Open **System Settings** → **Startup and Shutdown** → **Autostart**.
     2. Add a new script with the following content:
        ```bash
        eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
        ssh-add -k ~/.ssh/id_rsa
        ```

---

### Test the Setup
1. Restart your system.
2. Upon logging in, KWallet should unlock automatically, and your SSH key should be available.

---

### Troubleshooting
- **KWallet doesn’t unlock**: Ensure PAM integration is properly set up and that the wallet’s password matches your system login password.
- **SSH keys not added**: Verify `ssh-agent` is running and keys are listed with `ssh-add -l`.

This setup ensures seamless SSH key management integrated with KWalletManager on KDE.

plasma 6 kwalletmanager unlock ssh on login
## assistant

To configure **KWalletManager** to unlock your **SSH keys** automatically at login in **Plasma 6**, follow these steps:

---

### 1. **Enable KWallet to manage SSH keys**
KWallet has an integration feature to store and manage your SSH keys securely. To enable it:

1. Open **KWalletManager** (`kwalletmanager6`).
2. Open your default wallet (usually named *kdewallet*).
3. Ensure your wallet is unlocked at login:
   - Click the **Settings** menu.
   - Select **Configure Wallet**.
   - In the dialog box, ensure **Open wallet automatically on login** is enabled.

---

### 2. **Integrate SSH keys with KWallet**
You need to make SSH use KWallet for unlocking private keys:

1. **Check if `kwallet-pam` is installed**:
   - Install `kwallet-pam` (it ensures KWallet unlocks during login):
     - For Debian/Ubuntu:
       ```bash
       sudo apt install kwallet-pam
       ```
     - For Arch:
       ```bash
       sudo pacman -S kwallet-pam
       ```
     - For Fedora:
       ```bash
       sudo dnf install kwallet-pam
       ```

2. **Enable `kwallet-pam` integration**:
   - Open `/etc/pam.d/sddm` (or your display manager's PAM configuration file).
   - Add the following line near the top:
     ```plaintext
     auth    optional    pam_kwallet5.so
     session optional    pam_kwallet5.so auto_start
     ```

3. **Store your SSH key passphrases**:
   - Use `ssh-add` to add your keys:
     ```bash
     ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
     ```
   - KWallet will prompt to save the key. Accept the prompt.

---

### 3. **Test the integration**
1. Log out and log back in.
2. KWallet should unlock automatically during login, and your SSH keys should be accessible without re-entering passphrases.

---

### Troubleshooting
- If SSH keys are not loaded automatically, ensure the following:
  - The correct wallet is selected in **KWalletManager**.
  - Check for errors in `~/.xsession-errors` or via `journalctl`.
- Verify `ssh-agent` is running:
  ```bash
  eval "$(ssh-agent)"
  ```
