in meacs how do i  change case from allcaps to titilecase

In Emacs, you can change text from all caps to title case using a combination of commands and custom code. By default, Emacs has functions to change the case of regions of text (`downcase-region`, `upcase-region`, and `capitalize-region`), but it does not directly provide a title case transformation.

Here's how you can change text from all caps to title case in Emacs:

### Step 1: Select the region
1. Use `C-SPC` (Control + Space) to set the mark at the beginning of the text.
2. Move the cursor to the end of the text you want to change.

### Step 2: Create a custom function for title case
You can define a custom function in Emacs to convert all caps to title case, then apply it.

Add the following to your `.emacs` or `init.el` file:

```elisp
(defun title-case-region (start end)
  "Convert region from START to END to title case."
  (interactive "r")
  (let ((text (downcase (buffer-substring start end))))
    (delete-region start end)
    (insert (with-temp-buffer
              (insert text)
              (goto-char (point-min))
              (while (re-search-forward "\\b\\w" nil t)
                (replace-match (upcase (match-string 0)) t))
              (buffer-string)))))
```

### Step 3: Use the function
After evaluating the function, follow these steps to change the text to title case:

1. Select the text region.
2. Run the command `M-x title-case-region`.

This will convert the selected text to title case (capitalizing the first letter of each word and making the rest lowercase).

split a string in python including the split string
## assistant

To split a string in Python **and include the delimiter (split string)** in the result, you can use the `re.split()` function from the `re` (regular expressions) module with a capturing group.

### ‚úÖ Example: Split and include the delimiter

```python
import re

text = "one.TWO.three.FOUR"
result = re.split(r'(\.)', text)
print(result)
```

**Output:**
```
['one', '.', 'TWO', '.', 'three', '.', 'FOUR']
```

Here:
- `r'(\.)'` is a regular expression.
- The parentheses `()` **capture the delimiter** so it's included in the output.

---

### üîÅ Example: Split using multiple-word delimiter

```python
text = "apple--banana--cherry"
result = re.split(r'(--)', text)
print(result)
```

**Output:**
```
['apple', '--', 'banana', '--', 'cherry']
```

---

### üß† Tip:
- Without the capturing group (i.e., just `r'\.'`), the delimiter would **not** be included.
- This works with any delimiter, not just symbols‚Äîjust escape special regex characters if needed.

Let me know if you want to *split but keep delimiter at start/end of next part*!
