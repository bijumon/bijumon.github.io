is it possible to migrate existing SBI arogya plus insurance
## assistant

Yes, it is possible to migrate an existing **SBI Arogya Plus insurance policy** to another health insurance policy. Insurance portability allows policyholders to switch their health insurance policies from one insurer to another or to a different policy within the same insurer without losing accrued benefits like the waiting period for pre-existing conditions. Here are the steps involved:

### Steps for Policy Migration:
1. **Eligibility Check**:
   - Ensure that your existing policy is eligible for migration. Generally, policies can be ported or migrated at the time of renewal.

2. **Inform the Insurer**:
   - Notify **SBI General Insurance** about your intention to migrate the policy at least **45–60 days before the policy renewal date**.

3. **Choose a New Policy**:
   - Select the desired health insurance policy within SBI or from another insurer that suits your current needs.

4. **Submit Required Documents**:
   - You will need to provide:
     - Policy details of the existing plan.
     - Medical history records.
     - Renewal notice.
     - Any other documents requested by the insurer.

5. **Insurer's Review**:
   - The new insurer or policy team will assess your health details and the claim history of your current policy. They may also require you to undergo a medical check-up.

6. **Continuation of Benefits**:
   - On successful migration, you retain the **credit for the waiting period** you have already completed under your SBI Arogya Plus policy.

7. **Pay Premium**:
   - Pay the premium for the new policy once the migration is approved.

### Points to Note:
- **Coverage Differences**: The coverage features of the new policy might differ from your existing plan. Review the inclusions, exclusions, and terms carefully.
- **Pre-existing Conditions**: Ensure that the waiting period for pre-existing conditions and other time-bound benefits is carried forward to the new policy.
- **Policy Terms**: Migration may come with terms like a medical check-up or higher premiums based on your age and health.
