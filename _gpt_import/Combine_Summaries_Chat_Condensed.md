dirs[:] = [d for d in dirs if not d[0] == '.']
dirs[:] = [d for d in dirs if d not in exclude]
## assistant
You can combine those two lines into one comprehension like this:

```python
dirs[:] = [d for d in dirs if not (d[0] == '.' or d in exclude)]
```

This single line filters out the directories that start with a dot or are included in the `exclude` list.

files = [f for f in files if not f[0] == '.']
files = [ fi for fi in files if not fi.endswith(".dat") ]
## assistant
You can combine these two comprehensions like so:

```python
files = [f for f in files if not (f[0] == '.' or f.endswith(".dat"))]
```

This line filters out files that either start with a dot or end with ".dat".

## assistant
Certainly! You can merge those comprehensions into a single line like so:

```python
files = [f for f in files if not (f[0] == '.' or not f.endswith('.dat'))]
```

This line filters out files that either start with a dot or do not end with ".dat".
