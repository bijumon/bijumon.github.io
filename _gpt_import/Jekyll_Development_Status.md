Jekyll, a popular static site generator, has experienced a slowdown in development in recent years. Discussions among users indicate concerns about stalled progress and reduced activity from lead developers. citeturn0search1 Additionally, some users have expressed frustration over the lack of updates and have considered migrating to other platforms. citeturn0search4

Despite these challenges, Jekyll remains functional and continues to be used by many for generating static websites. However, the slowdown has led to the emergence of alternative static site generators, such as Bridgetown, which aim to offer modern features and maintain active development. citeturn0search3

In summary, while Jekyll is not "dead," its development has slowed, prompting some users to explore other options. As of the latest available information, the current lead developer is Ashwin Maroli, though his recent activity levels appear to be low. citeturn0search1
