Who was the German spy in black adder
## assistant

The German spy in *Blackadder Goes Forth* (the World War I series) is **Captain Kevin Darling**, portrayed by **Tim McInnerny**, in the episode titled **"General Hospital"** (Series 4, Episode 5).

In this episode, there's a hunt for a German spy at a British field hospital. Although several characters are under suspicion, the twist at the end reveals that **nurse Mary Fletcher-Brown**, who seemed sweet and innocent, is actually the German spy — not Captain Darling. So:

- **Red herring**: Captain Darling (suspected, but not guilty)
- **Actual spy**: Nurse Mary Fletcher-Brown

It's one of the more memorable plot twists in the series!
## assistant

The German spy in *Blackadder Goes Forth* (the fourth series of *Blackadder*) is **Herr Flick**, played by actor **Rowan Atkinson**. In the series, Herr Flick is a bumbling and incompetent spy working for the Germans during World War I. He is a parody of the stereotypical "enemy" spy figure, and his interactions with the main characters, especially Captain Blackadder, are often humorous and absurd.
## assistant

The German spy in *Blackadder Goes Forth* (Series 4) is revealed in the episode titled **"General Hospital"**. In this episode, Blackadder is sent to a hospital to uncover a German spy.

The spy turns out to be **Nurse Mary Fletcher-Brown**, played by **Miranda Richardson**. She pretends to be a sweet and innocent nurse but is ultimately exposed by Blackadder as the cunning spy sending British secrets to the Germans.

It’s a classic twist in typical *Blackadder* style — lots of wit, sarcasm, and deception.
