What is zerodol used for 
## assistant
Zerodol is a brand name for a medication that contains **aceclofenac**, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It is primarily used for pain relief and reducing inflammation. Some common conditions for which Zerodol is prescribed include:

1. **Arthritis (Osteoarthritis, Rheumatoid Arthritis, and Ankylosing Spondylitis):** Zerodol helps relieve joint pain, swelling, and stiffness associated with these conditions.

2. **Muscle and Joint Pain:** It can be used to treat various types of musculoskeletal pain, including back pain, neck pain, and sciatica.

3. **Post-Surgical Pain and Injury-Related Pain:** Zerodol may be prescribed to manage pain and inflammation after surgery or injuries such as fractures and sprains.

4. **Dental Pain:** It can help alleviate pain after dental procedures or due to dental conditions.

Since NSAIDs can have side effects, especially on the stomach, kidneys, and cardiovascular system, it’s best to use Zerodol under a doctor’s supervision.
