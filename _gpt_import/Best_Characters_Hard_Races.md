## assistant

In *Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed*, the best character for **hard races** depends on your playstyle and the track, but in general, you want someone with a **balanced or top-tier speed/handling combo**. Here are some of the **best characters** for hard races:

---

### 🔝 **Top-Tier Choices for Hard Races**

| Character | Strengths | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| **Metal Sonic** | Great speed and handling | Excellent for technical tracks and high speed |
| **Shadow** | High speed, good boost | Reliable for aggressive racers |
| **Vyse** (from Skies of Arcadia) | Well-rounded, great in water segments | Especially good on mixed-terrain tracks |
| **Tails** | Great handling and acceleration | Best for twisty tracks, but lower top speed |
| **Sonic** | High speed, average everything else | Solid pick for experienced players who can handle drifting |
| **Alex Kidd** | Balanced and responsive | Great for players who like control over raw speed |

---

### 🧠 **Tips for Hard Races**
- **Mods Matter**: Once you unlock character mods (Balanced, Speed, Handling, etc.), use the one that fits the track. For example, use **Handling** mod on tight courses.
- **Boost Management**: Drift often and use tricks when jumping to keep your boost gauge filled.
- **Weapons Smart Use**: Save ice shots or blowfish for choke points, and fire backwards if being chased.

---

### ⚠️ Avoid These on Hard Difficulty (Unless You're Skilled)
- **Heavy characters like Ralph or Football Manager** – They have high speed but poor handling.
- **Danica Patrick** – Very average stats, not ideal under pressure.

---

If you're just looking for a **safe all-around pick** to handle any hard track well, **Metal Sonic** or **Vyse** are great go-to characters. Want precise control? **Tails** or **Shadow** are great. If you're confident in high-speed driving, **Sonic** or **Shadow** will let you dominate.
