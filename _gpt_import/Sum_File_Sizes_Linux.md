in linux shell, find sum of file sizes

To find the sum of file sizes in a directory using the Linux shell, you can use several commands. Here are a few methods:

### Method 1: Using `du`
You can use the `du` (disk usage) command with the `-ch` option, which gives you a human-readable total:

```bash
du -ch * | grep total$
```

### Method 2: Using `find` and `awk`
If you want to include all files recursively in a directory and get the total size, you can use `find` combined with `awk`:

```bash
find . -type f -exec du -b {} + | awk '{total += $1} END {print total}'
```

This command will sum up the sizes of all files in the current directory and its subdirectories, outputting the total size in bytes.

### Method 3: Using `ls` and `awk`
If you only want the total size of files in the current directory (not recursive), you can use:

```bash
ls -l | awk '{sum += $5} END {print sum}'
```

### Method 4: Using `stat`
Another way to sum file sizes in the current directory:

```bash
stat --format="%s" * | awk '{sum += $1} END {print sum}'
```

### Explanation:
- `du -b`: Gives the size of files in bytes.
- `find . -type f`: Finds all files in the current directory and subdirectories.
- `awk '{total += $1} END {print total}'`: Sums the first column (file sizes).
- `ls -l`: Lists files with details, where the 5th column represents file size.
- `stat --format="%s"`: Outputs the size of each file in bytes.

in linux shell, find sum of file sizes of all opus files

To find the sum of file sizes of all `.opus` files in a directory and its subdirectories in a Linux shell, you can use the following command:

```bash
find . -type f -name "*.opus" -exec du -b {} + | awk '{sum += $1} END {print sum}'
```

### Breakdown of the command:

- `find .`: Searches in the current directory (`.`) and its subdirectories.
- `-type f`: Only considers files (not directories).
- `-name "*.opus"`: Filters for files that have the `.opus` extension.
- `-exec du -b {} +`: Executes the `du` command for each found file to get its size in bytes.
- `awk '{sum += $1} END {print sum}'`: Sums up the file sizes and prints the total.

This command will give you the total size of all `.opus` files in bytes. If you want the total size in a more human-readable format (like KB or MB), you can modify the command slightly:

```bash
find . -type f -name "*.opus" -exec du -b {} + | awk '{sum += $1} END {print sum/1024 " KB"}'
```

This version divides the total size by 1024 to convert bytes to kilobytes.

To find the sum of file sizes of all OPUS files in a directory (and its subdirectories) using the Linux shell, you can use the following command:

```bash
find . -name "*.opus" -exec du -b {} + | awk '{sum += $1} END {print sum}'
```

### Explanation:
- `find .`: Starts searching in the current directory (`.`).
- `-name "*.opus"`: Looks for files with the `.opus` extension.
- `-exec du -b {}`: Executes the `du` command for each found file, returning its size in bytes.
- `+`: Allows multiple files to be passed to `du` at once for efficiency.
- `| awk '{sum += $1} END {print sum}'`: Pipes the output to `awk`, which sums the file sizes and prints the total.

This command will give you the total size of all OPUS files in bytes. If you want the output in a more human-readable format, you can modify it as follows:

```bash
find . -name "*.opus" -exec du -b {} + | awk '{sum += $1} END {printf "%.2f MB\n", sum/1024/1024}'
```

This will display the total size in megabytes.
