In KDE Plasma, you can display an event notification and play a system sound using the following steps:

### 1. **Enable Notifications for Events**
   - Go to **System Settings** > **Notifications**.
   - In the **Notifications** section, find the application or event you want to configure. If the event belongs to a custom script or application, it might appear as a generic entry, or you may need to create it manually.

### 2. **Create a Custom Notification**
   - Select the application or event category. If it doesn't exist, choose the "Add Event" option or set it up programmatically for custom scripts.
   - Configure the following:
     - **Show a message in a popup**: Enable this to display a notification.
     - **Play a sound**: Enable this and select a sound file (you can use the system default sounds or provide your own).
     - Optional: Customize other actions like running commands or logging.

### 3. **Play a Sound**
   - You can set a sound directly in the event configuration in **Notifications**.
   - To play a sound programmatically, use the `play` or `paplay` command in a terminal or script. Example:
     ```bash
     paplay /usr/share/sounds/freedesktop/stereo/message.oga
     ```

### 4. **Display a Notification Programmatically**
   - Use the `notify-send` command to trigger a notification from a script or the terminal:
     ```bash
     notify-send "Event Title" "This is the event description."
     ```

### 5. **Combine Notification and Sound in a Script**
   - Create a script to trigger both a notification and play a sound. Example:
     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash
     notify-send "Event Triggered" "Your event has occurred."
     paplay /usr/share/sounds/freedesktop/stereo/message.oga
     ```

   - Save the script and make it executable:
     ```bash
     chmod +x script.sh
     ```

### 6. **Automate the Process**
   - Add your script to an automation tool, cron job, or as part of a triggered KDE event (e.g., when an application launches or a specific condition is met).

This approach provides a robust way to customize notifications and sounds in KDE Plasma.
