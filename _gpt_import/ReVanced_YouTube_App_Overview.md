ReVanced is a third-party project that provides modified versions of popular apps, particularly YouTube, with additional features. It essentially picks up where YouTube Vanced left off, after Vanced was discontinued. Some of ReVanced's features include:

- **Ad-blocking** for a cleaner viewing experience.
- **Background play**, allowing you to listen to audio with the screen off.
- **Customization options** for the UI and playback settings.
- **SponsorBlock integration** to skip sponsored segments within videos.

To use ReVanced, you generally need to download a patcher and apply it to the official app files, customizing it with the features you prefer.

ReVanced is a project that offers a modified version of the YouTube app, providing features commonly requested by users that are unavailable in the official YouTube app, especially after the discontinuation of YouTube Vanced. ReVanced's features often include ad-blocking, background playback, sponsor block, and customization options. Users need to patch the YouTube APK themselves using ReVanced Manager, which generates a personalized version based on user-selected features.
