early game with pedro against egypt cleopatra 
## assistant
Facing Cleopatra (Egypt) in the early game as **Pedro II (Brazil)** creates an interesting dynamic. Here's how to play the early game effectively, leveraging Brazil’s strengths while countering Egypt's early advantages:

---

### 🟢 **Brazil (Pedro II) – Early Game Goals**
Pedro's strengths come from:
- **Rainforest adjacency bonuses** for Campus, Holy Site, and Theater Square.
- **Extra Great People points** from districts.
- **Unique Improvement**: *Street Carnival* (Entertainment District replacement) provides amenities and Great People points.

---

### 🟠 **Cleopatra (Egypt) – Early Threats**
Cleopatra is dangerous early on because:
- She gets bonuses to **trading with allies** and **unit production near rivers**.
- Egypt can build **Wonders faster** near rivers and might rush military units early.

---

### 🌄 **Early Game Strategy with Pedro II vs. Cleopatra**

#### 🔬 **1. Tech Priorities**
- **Writing → Currency → Construction**  
  (To unlock Campuses, Commercial Hubs, and Builder upgrades)
- Build Campuses next to **Rainforests** ASAP for early science.

#### 🏛️ **2. District Planning**
- Use Brazil's rainforest advantage:
  - Place Campuses, Holy Sites, and Theater Squares for adjacency.
- Build the *Street Carnival* to boost **Amenities** and **Great People** acquisition.

#### ⚔️ **3. Defense vs. Cleopatra**
- Cleopatra tends to favor **early military** and river-adjacent expansion:
  - Scout early to locate her.
  - Build **a strong early defense**: Slingers → Archers → Spearmen or Warriors.
  - Fortify chokepoints near rivers if she’s nearby.

#### 🏙️ **4. Settling Strategy**
- Settle near Rainforests (for Pedro’s bonuses) and away from Cleopatra’s likely river spots.
- Avoid triggering her agenda by **not competing for Wonders** too early — let her build them while you focus on infrastructure.

#### 🛡️ **5. Diplomacy**
- Try not to share borders too soon. Cleopatra respects **strong militaries** — keep your army strength at least equal to hers.
- Trade luxuries for gold or favor to maintain good standing.

---

### 💡 Tips:
- Use **Pedro's Great People** bonus to build a strong cultural/scientific foundation.
- Don’t remove Rainforests — they’re Pedro’s power base unless it’s strategic for placement.
- Consider a Holy Site early if planning a cultural or religious win, as Brazil synergizes well with those paths too.

   - Enables fast religion founding or faith-purchasing Great People later.

2. **Divine Spark** – +1 Great Scientist/Prophet/Writer points from Campus, Holy Site, Theater Square
   - Helps turbo-charge your **Great Scientist** and **Engineer** progress.

#### 🟨 Good Alternatives:
- **God of the Open Sky** – If you’re in pasture-heavy land (less ideal for Brazil).
- **God of Craftsmen** – If Iron and Horses are nearby for early production.

👉 **Recommendation**: Pick **Divine Spark** unless you’re in heavy rainforest and want Sacred Path.

---

### ✝️ **Religion (If You Found One)**

Since your focus is **Science Victory**, religion is **optional**, but if you found one:

#### ✅ **Beliefs to Choose**:

- **Follower Belief**:  
  - **Work Ethic** – Converts faith into production based on Holy Site adjacency. Speeds up space projects. *(Best if you build a Holy Site)*  
  - **Jesuit Education** – Allows you to buy Campus and Theater Square buildings with faith. *(Synergizes with Sacred Path)*

- **Worship Building**:  
  - **Wat** – +2 Faith and **+2 Science** (amazing for science push).
  - **Cathedral** (optional, cultural backup)

- **Enhancer** (if you get to enhance):
