Was Zelda breath available on pc
## assistant

*The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild* was not officially released on PC. It was exclusively available on Nintendo platforms, specifically the Nintendo Switch and Wii U.

However, some people have used emulation software, like Cemu, to play the game on a PC. Emulation involves running console games on non-native platforms, but it often requires a legally obtained copy of the game and the right hardware to run it effectively. This method also falls into a legal gray area, especially if the game wasn't purchased legally or if it involves bypassing copyright protections.

Which Zelda was available on steam
## assistant
No official *The Legend of Zelda* games have been released on Steam or any other PC platform. The *Zelda* series is a flagship franchise for Nintendo, and they have kept it exclusive to their own consoles, such as the NES, SNES, N64, GameCube, Wii, Wii U, and Switch.

If you're looking for similar games on Steam, you might find indie titles like *Oceanhorn*, *Hob*, or *Tunche* that are inspired by the gameplay and style of *The Legend of Zelda* series.
