To copy the contents of `/opt` into `/mnt/` using `rsync`, you can use the following command:

```bash
sudo rsync -a /opt/ /mnt/
```

### Explanation:
- `sudo`: Ensures you have permission to read all files in `/opt` and write to `/mnt`.
- `rsync`: The tool used for copying files and directories efficiently.
- `-a`: Stands for "archive" mode; it preserves permissions, symbolic links, timestamps, etc.
- `/opt/`: The **trailing slash** is important—it means "copy the *contents* of `/opt`", not the directory itself.
- `/mnt/`: The destination directory.

If you want progress output and to see what’s being copied, add the `-v` (verbose) and `--progress` options:

```bash
sudo rsync -av --progress /opt/ /mnt/
```

Let me know if you want to exclude anything or do a dry run first!

To copy the entire contents of `/opt` into `/mnt`, preserving file attributes and directory structure, you can use the `cp` command with `-a` (archive) option:

```bash
sudo cp -a /opt/. /mnt/
```

### Explanation:
- `sudo`: Ensures you have the necessary permissions.
- `cp`: Copy command.
- `-a`: Archive mode (preserves symbolic links, file permissions, modification times, etc.).
- `/opt/.`: The `.` ensures contents of `/opt` are copied, not the directory itself.
- `/mnt/`: Destination directory.

Let me know if you also want to **move** instead of copy.
