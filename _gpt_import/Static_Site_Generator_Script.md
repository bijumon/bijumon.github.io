rewrite the following better

Here is my attempt to write a useful script in python. A static site generator which converts a folder of markdown files into html. We will be using python `3.12`, `uv` for managing external dependencies, `toml` or `yaml` frontmatter, `mistletoe` for markdown conversion and `jinja2` for templating.

list for files, pathlib for folders, dictionaries for storing data, f-strings for permalinks

Hereâ€™s my attempt at creating a useful Python script: a static site generator that converts a folder of Markdown files into HTML. This project uses Python `3.12`, `uv` for managing external dependencies, and supports either `TOML` or `YAML` front matter. We'll rely on `mistletoe` for Markdown conversion and `jinja2` for HTML templating.

The script makes use of the following:
- `list` for file handling
- `pathlib` for directory management
- `dict` for data storage
- `f-strings` for generating permalinks
