in jekyll liquid, show only posts from last week
## assistant

In Jekyll, to filter and show only posts from the last week using Liquid, you can use the `where` and `date` filters, as well as some custom logic for date comparison.

Here’s how you could do it in your template:

```liquid
{% assign today = "now" | date: "%s" %}
{% assign one_week_ago = today | minus: 604800 %} {# 604800 seconds in a week #}

{% for post in site.posts %}
  {% assign post_date = post.date | date: "%s" %}
  {% if post_date >= one_week_ago and post_date <= today %}
    <h2>{{ post.title }}</h2>
    <p>{{ post.date | date: "%B %d, %Y" }}</p>
    <p>{{ post.excerpt }}</p>
  {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
```

### Explanation:

1. `today` is assigned to the current date in seconds since epoch (`%s` format).
2. `one_week_ago` is set to 604,800 seconds (7 days) subtracted from `today`.
3. We loop through `site.posts` and convert each `post.date` to seconds.
4. We check if each `post_date` falls within the range from `one_week_ago` to `today`.

This will display only the posts from the past week. Adjust the display inside the loop as needed for your layout.

To show only posts from the last week in Jekyll using Liquid, you can use a combination of `where_exp` filters with date calculations. Unfortunately, Liquid doesn’t have built-in date calculations, so you’ll need to use the `date` filter creatively. Here’s a workaround:

```liquid
{% assign today = "now" | date: "%s" %}
{% assign one_week_ago = today | minus: 604800 %}

{% for post in site.posts %}
  {% assign post_date = post.date | date: "%s" %}
  {% if post_date >= one_week_ago %}
    <h2>{{ post.title }}</h2>
    <p>{{ post.date | date: "%B %d, %Y" }}</p>
    <p>{{ post.excerpt }}</p>
  {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
```

### Explanation
- `today`: The current date and time in seconds since the epoch.
- `one_week_ago`: One week before today’s date (604800 seconds in a week).
- `post_date`: Each post's date in seconds since the epoch.
- `if post_date >= one_week_ago`: Filters posts to only display ones from the last week. 

This will display only posts from the past 7 days. Adjust the seconds in `one_week_ago` if you want a different timeframe.
