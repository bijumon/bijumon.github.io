To view boot-related errors in `journalctl`, you can filter the systemd journal logs to only show messages related to boot issues. Here are some common ways to do this:

1. **View boot errors from the latest boot:**

   ```bash
   journalctl -p err -b
   ```

   - `-p err` limits the output to error-level messages.
   - `-b` specifies the current boot. Use `-b -1` for the previous boot, `-b -2` for the one before that, and so on.

2. **View boot messages (all levels) from the latest boot:**

   ```bash
   journalctl -b
   ```

3. **View critical, alert, and emergency messages (higher severity) from the latest boot:**

   ```bash
   journalctl -p crit -b
   ```

4. **Filter by systemd services with errors during boot:**

   To check for errors specifically with `systemd` services:

   ```bash
   journalctl -b -u <service-name>
   ```

   Replace `<service-name>` with the name of the service (e.g., `network.service`, `sshd.service`).

5. **Display messages related to specific keywords during boot:**

   You can also search for specific keywords, like "failed" or "error":

   ```bash
   journalctl -b | grep -i "failed"
   ```
