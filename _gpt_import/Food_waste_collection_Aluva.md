If you're looking for **food‑waste (organic waste) collection services in Aluva (Kerala)**, here's a snapshot of what's available and how residents are handling it:

---

## 🏙️ Municipality‑Led Initiatives

- **Bio-bins**: Aluva Municipality has distributed approximately **3,000 home bio‑bins** to households (from a total of about 6,000). These are used for source-level segregation and treatment. citeturn0search8turn0search2  
- **Community Support**: Kudumbashree workers have been engaged to train residents on how to use bio‑bins effectively, including adding the required bacterial inoculant. citeturn0search9turn0search2

- **Bio‑booths (“ATM‑model”)**: Since July 2025, **air-conditioned bio-waste booths** have been operational in front of the Aluva Town Hall and municipal office. These units can handle up to **1 tonne of food waste per day**, converting it into **biogas and manure**. People delivering waste pay ₹7/kg, with digital weighing and QR-code payments. Similar units are planned at the bus stand and TG Hall. citeturn0search0turn0search1

- **Decentralised Facility Timeline**: Until these systems scale further, the municipality continues to rely partly on Kochi’s Brahmapuram facility for biodegradable waste. Plans are underway for local processing, but full decentralisation will take more time. citeturn0search10turn0search2

## 🏘️ Apartment Complexes & Flats

- **Private collection systems**: Residents in many apartments either hire local firms or form associations that arrange daily or near-daily collection. Haritha Karma Sena or other local groups may handle this. citeturn0reddit19turn0reddit24

- **Onsite composting**: Some complexes install **biocompost or bio‑waste plants** for in‑house treatment, and periodic removal of compost or residue. citeturn0reddit19

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Citizen‑to‑Citizen Insights

From Reddit/Kochi users:
> “In the flat I lived earlier Harithakarmasena came and picked up the food waste everyday except Sunday.”  
> “We have contracted a company in Kochi to set up a biowaste plant on the terrace. They convert the food waste to manure.” citeturn0reddit19

Other users mention similar setups—biobins, composting, and bulk collection service fees (e.g., ₹100–₹250/month). citeturn0reddit12turn0reddit15

## 💡 How to Arrange Service

1. **Check if you received a bio-bin** from the municipality. Contact your local ward office or councillor if not.
2. **Ask neighbours or residents’ associations**—many areas already have arrangements with Haritha Karma Sena or private collectors.
3. **Locate a bio‑booth**: Visit the unit in front of the municipal hall to drop off your waste. In future, similar booths may open in other parts of Aluva.
4. **Consider home composting services**, like **Compost Master**, which provide devices and periodic servicing. citeturn0search3

## 🚀 Best Approach Going Forward

- **Start with source-level segregation**: Use a bio‑bin and inoculant if you have one.
- **If alone or small household**, drop organic kitchen waste in the bio‑booth at municipal hall.
- **In apartments**, coordinate with your association or neighbours to arrange group pickups or install onsite systems.
- **For more autonomy**, you can invest in a home-composting system and arrange periodic pickup of compost.
