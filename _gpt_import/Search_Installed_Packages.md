dnf search package in installed
## assistant

To search for a specific package among the installed packages using `dnf`, you can use the following command:

```bash
dnf list installed | grep package_name
```

Replace `package_name` with the name or part of the name of the package you are searching for.

If you want to see if a package is installed or not, you can directly use:

```bash
dnf list installed package_name
```

This will return the details of the package if it is installed. If the package isn't installed, the output will indicate that the package is not installed.

To search for an installed package using `dnf` on a Fedora or Red Hat-based system, you can use the following command:

```bash
dnf list installed | grep <package_name>
```

This command will list all installed packages and then filter the results to show only the package you are searching for. Replace `<package_name>` with the name of the package you're looking for.

If you want to see if a package is installed without searching through the entire list, you can use:

```bash
dnf list installed <package_name>
```

This will directly check if the specified package is installed on your system.

in fedora  how do i disable command not found
## assistant
On Fedora, the "command not found" feature is handled by a package called `PackageKit-command-not-found`. To disable this feature, you can either uninstall the package or modify the configuration.

### Option 1: Uninstall `PackageKit-command-not-found`
You can remove the package entirely with the following command:

```bash
sudo dnf remove PackageKit-command-not-found
```

This will completely disable the "command not found" functionality.

### Option 2: Modify Configuration
If you prefer to keep the package but disable the functionality, you can modify the shell configuration. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open the file `~/.bashrc` (if you're using Bash) or `~/.zshrc` (if you're using Zsh) in a text editor.

2. Add the following line to the end of the file:

   ```bash
   unset command_not_found_handle
   ```

3. Save the file and close the editor.

4. To apply the changes, run:

   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

   Or if you're using Zsh:

   ```bash
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

This will disable the "command not found" functionality for your user session.
