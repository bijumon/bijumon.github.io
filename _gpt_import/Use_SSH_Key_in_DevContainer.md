howto use host ssh key in devcontainer vscode

To use your **host SSH key** inside a **DevContainer in VSCode**, you can forward the SSH agent from your host into the container. Here's how to set it up:

---

### 🔧 1. **Ensure SSH Agent is Running on Host**
Make sure your SSH agent is running and your key is added:

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa  # or your key file
```

---

### 🧱 2. **Enable SSH Agent Forwarding in DevContainer**

In your `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` (or `.devcontainer.json`), add the following configuration:

```json
"mounts": [
  "type=bind,source=${env:SSH_AUTH_SOCK},target=/ssh-agent"
],
"containerEnv": {
  "SSH_AUTH_SOCK": "/ssh-agent"
}
```

This:
- Mounts the SSH socket from your host into the container.
- Sets the `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` environment variable in the container so `ssh` can use the host agent.

---

### ✅ 3. **Optional: Install SSH Client in Container**

If not already installed, make sure the container has the OpenSSH client:

For **Debian/Ubuntu** base:

```Dockerfile
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y openssh-client
```

---

### 🔁 4. **Rebuild the Container**

After changing the `devcontainer.json`, reopen the DevContainer or rebuild it:

**Command Palette →** `Dev Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container`

---

### 🧪 5. **Test SSH Inside DevContainer**

In the DevContainer terminal:

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

You should see something like:

```
Hi username! You've successfully authenticated...
```

---

### 💡 Notes:
- This does **not copy** your SSH key into the container—it's safer because your host handles the key.
- Works well with GitHub, GitLab, private git servers, etc.
