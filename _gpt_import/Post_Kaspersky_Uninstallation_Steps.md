After uninstalling Kaspersky from Windows 10, it's essential to ensure your system remains secure. Here's what you should do:

### 1. **Confirm Kaspersky is Fully Uninstalled**  
   - Use the **Kaspersky Removal Tool**: Sometimes, uninstallation leaves behind residual files. Download and run the [Kaspersky Removal Tool](https://support.kaspersky.com/common/uninstall/1464) to clean up completely.
   - Check for leftover files in these locations:  
     - `C:\Program Files`  
     - `C:\ProgramData`  
     - `C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local` or `Roaming`.

### 2. **Enable Windows Defender**  
   - If Kaspersky was your primary antivirus, ensure Windows Defender (built into Windows 10) is enabled:  
     - Go to **Settings > Update & Security > Windows Security**.  
     - Open **Virus & threat protection** and check if it's active.
   - Run a quick scan to verify there are no immediate threats.

### 3. **Update Windows**  
   - Ensure Windows 10 is fully updated:  
     - Go to **Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update**.  
     - Install all pending updates for improved security and stability.

### 4. **Install a New Antivirus (Optional)**  
   If you want additional protection beyond Windows Defender, consider lightweight and reliable antivirus software, such as:  
   - **Bitdefender Free**  
   - **Avast Free Antivirus**  
   - **ESET NOD32**  
   Choose one that fits your needs.

### 5. **Verify Firewall and Network Protection**  
   - Make sure the **Windows Firewall** is active:  
     - Go to **Control Panel > System and Security > Windows Defender Firewall**.  
     - Check that it's enabled for both private and public networks.

### 6. **Practice Safe Computing**  
   - Avoid downloading unknown files or clicking on suspicious links.  
   - Keep your browser and installed apps updated.

### 7. **Optional: System Scan for Malware**  
   Use tools like **Malwarebytes Free** or **AdwCleaner** for a secondary check to ensure your system is clean.
