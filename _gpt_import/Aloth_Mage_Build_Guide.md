For Aloth in *Pillars of Eternity II*, focusing on his role as a powerful mage can make him a highly effective spellcaster in both damage-dealing and crowd-control roles. Here’s a detailed build that aims to maximize his utility and damage output, along with recommended skills and abilities.

### Build Overview: Battle Mage Aloth
This build emphasizes a combination of strong area-of-effect (AoE) spells, crowd control, and survivability. You can choose to make him a single-class Wizard or go for a multiclass with Fighter (creating a Battle Mage), allowing him to hold his ground in mid-range.

### Stats
A good stat distribution for Aloth’s role as a mage includes:
- **Might**: Medium (for balanced damage)
- **Constitution**: Low (since he should ideally stay at range)
- **Dexterity**: High (to reduce casting time)
- **Perception**: Medium-High (for better accuracy with spells)
- **Intellect**: Very High (for increased AoE radius and duration on spells)
- **Resolve**: Medium-Low (since you can keep him protected at the back)

### Skills
For Aloth's skills, prioritize the following based on your overall party composition and his role as a mage.

#### Active Skills
- **Arcana**: High. This will allow him to use scrolls effectively, which complements his magic casting for more versatility.
- **Alchemy**: Medium. While not essential, it boosts the power of potions he might use to increase his survivability.
- **Athletics**: Low-Medium. A few points can help with Second Wind, providing an emergency self-heal if needed.

#### Passive Skills
- **History**: High. Aloth benefits from the Lore skill for story purposes, and History adds flavor to his character. 
- **Insight**: Medium. This can help him in dialogue checks and add narrative depth.
- **Mechanics**: If your party lacks a dedicated trap disarmer, investing in Mechanics can be helpful, but it’s typically not a priority for him.

### Abilities
This section is for a single-class Wizard build with some optional suggestions if you go Battle Mage.

#### Leveling Path (Wizard)
Here’s a progression outline for Aloth as a pure Wizard:

1. **Level 1**:
   - **Minoletta’s Minor Missiles**: Reliable single-target damage.
   - **Fleet Feet**: For enhanced mobility if he needs to reposition quickly.

2. **Level 2**:
   - **Chill Fog**: Excellent AoE control spell with a chance to blind.

3. **Level 3**:
   - **Arcane Veil**: Increases Deflection in emergency situations.
   - **Mirrored Image**: Useful for survivability in the mid-game.

4. **Level 4**:
   - **Fireball**: Essential AoE spell for clearing out groups.
   - **Miasma of Dull-Mindedness**: Useful debuff that reduces enemy Perception, Intellect, and Resolve.

5. **Level 5**:
   - **Arcane Reflection**: Reflects enemy spells and is highly useful for defense.

6. **Level 6**:
   - **Delayed Fireball**: A stronger AoE spell with a delayed fuse, great for crowd control.

7. **Level 7**:
   - **Arcane Dampener**: Cancels enemy beneficial effects—essential against tougher opponents.

8. **Level 8**:
   - **Ninagauth’s Freezing Pillar**: High-damage AoE with a strong freeze effect.

9. **Level 9**:
   - **Essential Phantom**: Creates a duplicate of Aloth to cast additional spells, which can turn the tide in larger battles.

10. **Level 10 and Beyond**:
    - **Wall of Draining**: Great for removing enemy buffs over time.
    - **Minoletta’s Precisely Piercing Burst**: Upgraded damage spell that bypasses enemy defenses.
    - **Meteor Shower**: An ultimate spell with devastating AoE damage potential.

#### Battle Mage Alternative Abilities
If you multiclass Aloth with Fighter to create a Battle Mage:
- **Disciplined Barrage**: Increases his accuracy, ensuring spells hit.
- **Tactical Barrage**: Grants Perception and Intellect, synergizing well with his spells.
- **Unbending Trunk**: Adds some healing and makes him more durable.
  
### Equipment
- **Grimoire**: Choose a Grimoire with strong utility and damage spells to enhance his spellcasting options.
- **Armor**: Light armor for a balance between casting speed and protection.
- **Weapons**: A wand or scepter is optimal for ranged damage; if multiclassed, consider a sword and shield for survival at mid-range.

### Party Synergy
Pair Aloth with a tank and melee DPS to keep enemies at a distance, allowing him to safely cast spells. A Priest can also enhance Aloth's survivability and provide additional buffs to maximize his spellcasting power.

This build gives Aloth versatility as a powerful mage, balanced for both mid and late-game, providing impactful spells and strong utility in most encounters. Let me know if you’d like suggestions for a specific party setup around this build!
