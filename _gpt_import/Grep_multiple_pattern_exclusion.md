To make `grep` ignore multiple patterns, you can use several approaches. Here are the most common ones:

### 1. **Using `--invert-match` (`-v`) with a regex pattern**
You can specify a regex pattern with alternation (`|`) to exclude multiple patterns in a single command.

```bash
grep -Ev "pattern1|pattern2|pattern3" file
```

- `-E`: Enables extended regex.
- `-v`: Inverts the match to exclude lines that match the pattern.

### 2. **Using Multiple `--invert-match` Flags**
You can chain multiple `-v` options for each pattern.

```bash
grep -v "pattern1" file | grep -v "pattern2" | grep -v "pattern3"
```

### 3. **Using a File with Exclusion Patterns**
If you have a list of patterns to ignore, you can save them to a file and use `grep` with the `-f` option.

#### Steps:
1. Create a file named `exclude_patterns.txt`:
   ```
   pattern1
   pattern2
   pattern3
   ```
2. Run the command:
   ```bash
   grep -v -f exclude_patterns.txt file
   ```

- `-f exclude_patterns.txt`: Reads patterns from the specified file.
- `-v`: Excludes lines matching the patterns.

### Example
Assume `file.txt` contains:
```
apple
banana
cherry
date
elderberry
fig
grape
```

#### Command:
```bash
grep -Ev "banana|cherry|fig" file.txt
```

#### Output:
```
apple
date
elderberry
grape
```
