in fedora, how to find largest installed packeges
## assistant

To find the largest installed packages in Fedora, you can use the `dnf` command with options that sort packages by their size. Here are a few methods:

### Method 1: Using `dnf` with `--queryformat`
This command lists the installed packages sorted by size in descending order:

```bash
dnf list installed --queryformat "%{size} %{name}" | sort -rh | head -n 20
```

- `--queryformat "%{size} %{name}"` formats the output to show the size first, then the package name.
- `sort -rh` sorts the output in human-readable format and in reverse order (largest size at the top).
- `head -n 20` limits the output to the top 20 largest packages.

### Method 2: Using `dnf repoquery` (requires `dnf-plugins-core`)
If you don’t have `dnf-plugins-core` installed, you can install it with:

```bash
sudo dnf install dnf-plugins-core
```

Then run:

```bash
dnf repoquery --installed --qf '%{size} %{name}' | sort -rh | head -n 20
```

### Method 3: Using `rpm` directly
You can also use the `rpm` command to list packages and their sizes:

```bash
rpm -qa --queryformat '%{SIZE}\t%{NAME}\n' | sort -rh | head -n 20
```

This will show the size in bytes along with the package name.

These commands should give you an overview of the largest installed packages on your Fedora system.

To find the largest installed packages in Fedora, you can use the `dnf` package manager with the following command:

```bash
dnf list installed --installedsize | sort -k3 -h
```

### Explanation
1. **`dnf list installed --installedsize`**: Lists all installed packages with their size.
2. **`sort -k3 -h`**: Sorts the output by the third column (size) in a human-readable format.

The packages at the bottom of this list will be the largest. If you want only the top 10 largest packages, you can add `tail -n 10`:

```bash
dnf list installed --installedsize | sort -k3 -h | tail -n 10
```

Alternatively, you can use this command for a more concise output:

```bash
rpm -qa --queryformat '%{size} %{name}\n' | sort -n | tail -10
```

This command lists the package name and size, sorting by size in ascending order.

To find the largest installed packages on Fedora, you can use the following command:

```bash
dnf repoquery --installed --qf '%{name} %{size}' | sort -k2 -n -r | head -n 20
```

### Explanation:
- `dnf repoquery --installed`: Lists all installed packages.
- `--qf '%{name} %{size}'`: Customizes the output to show the package name and size.
- `sort -k2 -n -r`: Sorts the output by the second column (size) in descending order.
- `head -n 20`: Shows the top 20 largest packages.

This will display the 20 largest installed packages along with their sizes. Adjust `head -n 20` to see more or fewer packages.

dnf download only
## assistant
In Fedora, you can use the `dnf download` command to download packages without installing them. Here’s how you can do it:

1. **To download a specific package:**

   ```bash
   dnf download <package-name>
   ```

   Replace `<package-name>` with the name of the package you want to download.

2. **To download a package along with its dependencies** (without installing anything):

   ```bash
   dnf download --resolve <package-name>
   ```

   The `--resolve` option ensures that all dependencies of the specified package are also downloaded.

3. **To download multiple packages at once**:

   ```bash
   dnf download <package1> <package2> <package3> ...
   ```

   Just list the packages separated by spaces to download them together.

4. **To download a package of a specific version**:

   ```bash
   dnf download <package-name>-<version>
   ```

   Specify the version you need after the package name.

The downloaded packages will be saved in the current directory as `.rpm` files, allowing you to transfer or install them later with `dnf install` or `rpm`.

dnf download updates but dont install them
## assistant
To download updates without installing them on Fedora, use the following command:

```bash
dnf update --downloadonly
```

This command downloads the update packages to the system cache (usually located in `/var/cache/dnf/`) but does not install them.

### Additional Options:
- **To specify a different download location**:
  
  ```bash
  dnf update --downloadonly --downloaddir=<path-to-directory>
  ```

  Replace `<path-to-directory>` with the folder where you want to save the downloaded updates.

- **To preview what will be downloaded** (without actually downloading anything):

  ```bash
  dnf check-update
  ```

This way, you can download all updates in advance without installing them, which is useful for offline updates or if you want to review packages before installing.

fedora 42 uses wayland, how to install xorg and qtile and login from sddm
## assistant

To install **Xorg** and the **Qtile window manager** on **Fedora 42** and use it with **SDDM**, follow these steps:

---

### ✅ 1. **Install Xorg**
Fedora Workstation defaults to Wayland, but Xorg is still available.

Install Xorg server and related tools:

```bash
sudo dnf install xorg-x11-server-Xorg xorg-x11-xinit xorg-x11-utils xterm
```

---

### ✅ 2. **Install Qtile**
Qtile is available in Fedora's repositories:

```bash
sudo dnf install qtile
```

You can verify it with:

```bash
qtile --version
```

---

### ✅ 3. **Create a Qtile X session for SDDM**

Create a Qtile `.desktop` session file so it appears in SDDM:

```bash
sudo tee /usr/share/xsessions/qtile.desktop > /dev/null <<EOF
[Desktop Entry]
Name=Qtile
Comment=Qtile Session
Exec=qtile start
Type=Application
X-LightDM-DesktopName=Qtile
DesktopNames=qtile
EOF
```

---

### ✅ 4. **Ensure SDDM is installed and enabled**

If you're not already using SDDM:

```bash
sudo dnf install sddm
sudo systemctl enable sddm
sudo systemctl set-default graphical.target
```

---

### ✅ 5. **Switch to Xorg in SDDM**

SDDM detects the session type automatically from `.desktop` files. If you see "Qtile" on the session list, it will launch it using Xorg.

To ensure Xorg is used (instead of Wayland), you can explicitly disable Wayland for SDDM:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/sddm.conf.d/
sudo tee /etc/sddm.conf.d/10-xorg.conf > /dev/null <<EOF
[General]
Session=qtile.desktop

[Wayland]
Enable=false
EOF
```

---

### ✅ 6. **Reboot and Login**

Now reboot:

```bash
reboot
```

At the SDDM login screen:
- Choose **"Qtile"** from the session menu.
- Log in, and Qtile should start using Xorg.

---

### ✅ Optional: Add `.xinitrc` for testing without SDDM

For testing from a TTY:

```bash
echo "exec qtile start" > ~/.xinitrc
startx
```

---

Let me know if you want a **starter config** for Qtile or want to use **Wayland + Qtile** instead (via `qtile wayland` experiment).
