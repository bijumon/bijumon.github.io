For Serafen, who starts as a Cipher in *Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire*, a good build leverages his racial bonus (Orlan's Minor Threat) and Cipher abilities to deal consistent damage while providing crowd control and utility. Here’s a detailed build:

### **Class**: Cipher (Wild Mind or Ascendant)
- **Wild Mind** adds a chaotic element but can be fun; random spells might disrupt plans.
- **Ascendant** is more reliable, offering a significant boost in focus-based spellcasting.

---

### **Race**: Orlan
- **Minor Threat** synergizes well with high crit-based attacks, amplifying effectiveness.

---

### **Attributes**:
Allocate attribute points based on this priority:
- **Might**: High (increases damage and healing).
- **Dexterity**: High (faster action speed).
- **Perception**: High (improves accuracy and interrupts).
- **Intellect**: Moderate (extends Cipher ability duration and AoE size).
- **Constitution**: Moderate (for survivability).
- **Resolve**: Low (not a priority, unless tanking).

---

### **Weapons**:
- **Dual-wield pistols/blunderbusses** (focus generation with crits).
- **Melee weapons** like sabres (if close combat is preferred).
- Look for weapons that add crit bonuses or drain focus.

---

### **Active Cipher Abilities**:
Prioritize focus generation and crowd control:
1. **T1**: *Mind Wave* (AoE knockdown) / *Eyestrike* (blind enemies).
2. **T2**: *Puppet Master* (dominate enemies) / *Psychovampiric Shield* (weaken enemy defenses).
3. **T3**: *Borrowed Instinct* (boost your accuracy and defenses).
4. **T4**: *Amplified Wave* (massive AoE knockback and prone effect).
5. **T5**: *Disintegration* (high single-target DoT).

---

### **Passive Cipher Abilities**:
1. **Draining Whip** (gain more focus from weapon attacks).
2. **Hammering Thoughts** (increase focus gain from attacks).
3. **Shared Nightmare** (increase AoE of powers like *Eyestrike*).

---

### **Skills**:
- **Active**: Mechanics (unlock traps and chests) or Stealth (ambush setups).
- **Passive**: Insight (roleplay) or Survival (utility for rest bonuses).

---

### **Tactics**:
- **Focus Generation**: Use weapon attacks (dual pistols/blunderbusses are great for crits) to quickly build focus.
- **Crowd Control**: Apply AoE blinds or dominate high-damage enemies early in fights.
- **Damage Output**: Use powers like *Disintegration* or *Amplified Wave* for impactful contributions.
- **Buff/Debuff Management**: Utilize *Borrowed Instinct* to sustain Serafen’s effectiveness.

---

### **Companion Role**:
Serafen works well as a versatile damage dealer or secondary crowd control specialist. Pair him with tanks like Eder or Pallegina to hold the line while he picks apart the enemy’s backline.
