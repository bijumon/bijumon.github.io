move all *.rpmnew files in /etc/apparmour.d to original files

To replace the original files in `/etc/apparmor.d` with their corresponding `.rpmnew` files, follow these steps carefully:

### 1. **Understand `.rpmnew` Files**
   - RPM packages create `.rpmnew` files when configuration files have changed, but your existing files have been modified and cannot be safely overwritten.

### 2. **Backup the Original Files**
   To ensure no data is lost, back up the current configuration files:
   ```bash
   sudo cp -r /etc/apparmor.d /etc/apparmor.d.bak
   ```

### 3. **Move `.rpmnew` Files**
   You can move the `.rpmnew` files to their original locations with the following command:
   ```bash
   for file in /etc/apparmor.d/*.rpmnew; do
       original="${file%.rpmnew}"  # Remove '.rpmnew' to get the original file path
       if [[ -f "$original" ]]; then
           sudo mv "$file" "$original"
           echo "Replaced $original with $file"
       else
           sudo mv "$file" "$original"
           echo "Moved $file to $original (original was missing)"
       fi
   done
   ```

### 4. **Reload AppArmor Profiles**
   After replacing the files, reload the AppArmor profiles to apply the changes:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl reload apparmor
   ```

### 5. **Verify the Changes**
   Ensure the AppArmor profiles are working correctly:
   ```bash
   sudo aa-status
   ```

### Important Notes:
   - Compare the `.rpmnew` files with the originals before replacing them if you are unsure about the changes:
     ```bash
     diff /etc/apparmor.d/<original_file> /etc/apparmor.d/<original_file>.rpmnew
     ```
   - Keep a backup for troubleshooting if the replacement causes issues.
