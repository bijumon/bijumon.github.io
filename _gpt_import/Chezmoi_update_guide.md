1. **Detect Changes**
   Run the following command to see the differences between your actual system files and the Chezmoi repository:

   ```

2. **Add Changes**
   If the changes look correct, apply them to your Chezmoi repository:

   ```

3. **Apply Changes**

To update changes into your [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io) repository, follow these steps:

### 1. **Add Changes to chezmoi**
   If you've made changes directly to files in your home directory that are managed by chezmoi, you need to tell chezmoi to update its state. Use:

   ```bash
   chezmoi add <file-path>
   ```

   Example:
   ```bash
   chezmoi add ~/.bashrc
   ```

   This adds the modified file to chezmoi's state.

---

### 2. **Apply Changes from chezmoi's State**
   If you've made changes in the chezmoi source directory, apply them to your home directory with:

   ```bash
   chezmoi apply
   ```

---

### 3. **Commit Changes (if using a Git repository)**
   If you're using chezmoi with Git for version control:

   ```bash
   cd ~/.local/share/chezmoi
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update configuration"
   ```

---

### 4. **Push Changes to Remote Repository**
   If you have a remote Git repository configured, push the updates:

   ```bash
   git push
   ```

---

### 5. **Pull Changes on Other Machines**
   To sync changes to other systems:

   ```bash
   chezmoi update
   ```

This will pull the latest changes from your remote repository and apply them.

---

### Tips:
- **Dry Run**: Before applying changes, preview what will happen with:
  ```bash
  chezmoi apply --dry-run
  ```
  
- **Diff Changes**: View differences between the current state and the chezmoi state:
  ```bash
  chezmoi diff
  ```
