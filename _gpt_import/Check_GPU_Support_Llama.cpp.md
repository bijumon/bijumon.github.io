how can I check if llama.cpp is built with GPU support
## assistant

Good question!  
To **check if your `llama.cpp` build has GPU support**, you can do one (or more) of these:

---

**1. Check when running**  
Run a command like:

```bash
./main -h
```
or (if you built a different example binary)

```bash
./chat -h
```

In the help output, look for something like:

- **"Compiled with support for cuBLAS"** (for NVIDIA CUDA)
- **"Compiled with support for Metal"** (for Apple GPUs)
- **"Compiled with support for Vulkan"** (for Vulkan backend)
- **"Compiled with support for CLBlast"** (for OpenCL)

If you see any of those, it means GPU support is enabled for that backend.

---

**2. Look at compile-time flags**  
If you still have the build output or your `CMakeCache.txt`, check if it mentions:

- `LLAMA_CUBLAS=ON` (CUDA support)
- `LLAMA_METAL=ON` (Apple Metal support)
- `LLAMA_VULKAN=ON` (Vulkan backend support)
- `LLAMA_CLBLAST=ON` (OpenCL backend support)

You can also re-run `cmake` manually in your build directory and see what it detects.

Example:

```bash
cmake ..
```
and you'll see lines like:

```
-- Enabled cuBLAS support
-- Enabled Vulkan support
```

---

**3. If running inside code**  
If you are coding or modifying llama.cpp itself, you can check at runtime with:

```cpp
printf("%s\n", llama_print_system_info());
```

It will output system info including whether GPU backends are active.

---

**Quick note**:  
- Even if built with GPU support, **you still need to specify `--gpu-layers N`** when you run the model for it to actually *use* the GPU.
- If you donâ€™t set `--gpu-layers`, it will just use CPU by default!

Example run with GPU layers:

```bash
./main -m models/yourmodel.gguf --gpu-layers 35
```

---

Would you like me to also show you a *simple test* you can run to **see if the GPU is really being used during inference**? ðŸš€  
(like checking your `nvidia-smi` or using system monitors?)

Good question â€” it's actually pretty quick to check if your `llama.cpp` build has GPU support!

Here are a few ways:

---

**1. Look at the build options in `CMakeCache.txt`:**

If you built with CMake, go into your `build/` folder and open `CMakeCache.txt`, then search for things like:

- `GGML_CUBLAS`
- `GGML_CLBLAST`
- `GGML_METAL`
- `GGML_SYCL`

If `GGML_CUBLAS` (for NVIDIA CUDA) is `ON`, that means it's built with CUDA GPU support.

Example line:

```plaintext
GGML_CUBLAS:BOOL=ON
```

**Meaning:** CUDA (NVIDIA GPU) support is enabled.

---

**2. Run the binary with `--help` or look at the logs when you load a model:**

If you run a command like:

```bash
./main -m models/yourmodel.gguf --help
```

or just start loading a model, the console output often tells you things like:

```plaintext
llama.cpp: loading model ...
llama.cpp: using CUDA for acceleration
```

If you see something like `using CUDA`, `using Metal`, `using OpenCL`, or `using SYCL`, that's GPU support confirmed.

---

**3. Inspect the binary itself (optional, geeky way):**

You can use `ldd` (on Linux) to check if your executable is linked to CUDA libraries:

```bash
ldd ./main | grep cuda
```

If you see links to `libcublas.so`, `libcudart.so`, etc., GPU support is built-in.

---

**4. Rebuild to be sure:**

You can always force a rebuild and set it explicitly:

```bash
cmake -DLLAMA_CUBLAS=ON ..
make -j
```

(replace `CUBLAS` with `CLBLAST`, `METAL`, or whatever backend you want)

---

**Summary:**
- Check `CMakeCache.txt`
- Look at runtime logs
- `ldd` to see linked libraries
- (Optional) rebuild with explicit GPU flags

---

Would you like me to show you how to very quickly detect it at runtime **inside your own C++ code** too? (super easy, like a 2-line function) ðŸ”¥  
Would be useful if you're writing scripts! ðŸš€

build llama.cpp with rocm support

## assistant

Got it â€” you want to **build `llama.cpp`** (the local LLM inference project) **with ROCm** support, to run on an AMD GPU. Let's walk through it.

---

First, here's the overview of what you need:

âœ… ROCm installed and working on your system (you can run `rocminfo` and `clinfo` to verify)  
âœ… CMake installed (`cmake --version`)  
âœ… A modern C++ compiler (like `clang++` or `g++`)  
âœ… llama.cpp source code (`git clone https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp`)  

---

### Step 1: Install dependencies

Make sure ROCm libraries are ready:

```bash
sudo apt install rocm-dev rocm-libs hipblas rocblas
```

Or whatever package names fit your distro. (Some systems require `hipify-clang` too.)

Also install build tools:

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential cmake
```

---

### Step 2: Clone `llama.cpp`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp
cd llama.cpp
```

---

### Step 3: Build with ROCm support

You'll use the `-DLLAMA_HIPBLAS=ON` flag to enable HIP/ROCblas backend.

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DLLAMA_HIPBLAS=ON
make -j$(nproc)
```

If your system's HIP isn't installed into standard system paths, you might also need to set:

```bash
export CXX=hipcc
```

before running `cmake`.

---

### Step 4: Run

After build finishes, you should have a `./main` or similar binary ready to use.  
Try running a model like:

```bash
./main -m ./models/your-model.gguf
```

and see if it properly detects and uses ROCm.

You can also add `-ngl N` argument to control the number of GPU layers used.

---

### Quick Note
- ROCm support in `llama.cpp` is not as mature as CUDA yet â€” it works but sometimes needs tuning.
- If you have issues during build like "cannot find rocblas.h" or similar, it usually means HIP environment variables (`HIP_PATH`, `ROCM_PATH`) are not correctly set.

---

Would you like me to show you an **even faster ROCm-specific build script** (like a single `.sh` file you can copy-paste)? ðŸš€  
I can also help troubleshoot if your ROCm installation needs checking.  
Want me to? ðŸŽ¯
